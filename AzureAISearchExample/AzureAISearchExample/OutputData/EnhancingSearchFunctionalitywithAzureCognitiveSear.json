It represents documents andqueries as vectors in a high-dimensional space called an embedding. By understandingthe intent behind the query, Vector Search can deliver more relevant results that alignwith the user\u0027s requirements, even if the exact terms are not present in the document.Moreover, Vector Search can be applied to various types of content, including imagesand videos, not just text.To learn how to index vector fields and perform vector search, you can refer to thesample. This sample provides detailed guidance on indexing vector fields anddemonstrates how to perform vector search.Additionally, for more comprehensive information about Vector Search, including itsconcepts and usage, you can refer to the documentation. The documentation providesin-depth explanations and guidance on leveraging the power of Vector Search in AzureCognitive Search.The following examples all use a simple Hotel data set that you can import into yourown index from the Azure portal. These are just a few of the basics - please check outour Samples for much more.\n"
