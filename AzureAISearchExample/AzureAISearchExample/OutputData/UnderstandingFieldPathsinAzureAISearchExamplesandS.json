In filters, a field pathrefers to the value of a single instance of a field in the current document. In othercontexts, such as $orderby, $select, or in fielded search in the full Lucene syntax, a fieldpath refers to the field itself. This difference has some consequences for how you usefield paths in filters.Consider the field path Address/City. In a filter, this refers to a single city for the currentdocument, like \u0022San Francisco\u0022.\n"
