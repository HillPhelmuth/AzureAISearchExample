  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfYou can use an indexer as the sole means for data ingestion, or in combination withother techniques. The following table summarizes the main scenarios.ScenarioStrategySingle datasourceThis pattern is the simplest: one data source is the sole content provider for asearch index. Most supported data sources provide some form of changedetection so that subsequent indexer runs pick up the difference when contentis added or updated in the source.Multiple datasourcesAn indexer specification can have only one data source, but the search indexitself can accept content from multiple sources, where each indexer run bringsnew content from a different data provider.\r\nEach source can contribute itsshare of full documents, or populate selected fields in each document. For acloser look at this scenario, see Tutorial: Index from multiple data sources.MultipleindexersMultiple data sources are typically paired with multiple indexers if you need tovary run time parameters, the schedule, or field mappings.Cross-region scale out of Cognitive Search is another scenario. You might havecopies of the same search index in different regions. To synchronize searchindex content, you could have multiple indexers pulling from the same dataIndexer scenarios and use casesScenarioStrategysource, where each indexer targets a different search index in each region.\r\nParallel indexing of very large data sets also requires a multi-indexer strategy,where each indexer targets a subset of the data.ContenttransformationIndexers drive AI enrichment. Content transforms are defined in a skillset thatyou attach to the indexer.You should plan on creating one indexer for every target index and data sourcecombination. You can have multiple indexers writing into the same index, and you canreuse the same data source for multiple indexers. However, an indexer can onlyconsume one data source at a time, and can only write to a single index. As thefollowing graphic illustrates, one data source provides input to one indexer, which thenpopulates a single index:Although you can only use one indexer at a time, resources can be used in differentcombinations. The main takeaway of the next illustration is to notice is that a datasource can be paired with more than one indexer, and multiple indexers can write tosame index.Indexers crawl data stores on Azure and outside of Azure.\n"
