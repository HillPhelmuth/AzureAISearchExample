  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfA stable index location. Moving an existing index to a different search service isn\u0027tsupported out-of-the-box. Revisit application requirements and make sure thatyour existing search service, its capacity and location, are sufficient for your needs.Finally, all service tiers have index limits on the number of objects that you cancreate. For example, if you\u0027re experimenting on the Free tier, you can only havethree indexes at any given time. Within the index itself, there are limits on thenumber of complex fields and collections.A search index has one required field: a document key. A document key is the uniqueidentifier of a search document.\r\nIn Azure Cognitive Search, it must be a string, and itmust originate from unique values in the data source that\u0027s providing the content to beindexed. A search service doesn\u0027t generate key values, but in some scenarios (such asPrerequisitesDocument keysthe Azure Table indexer) it synthesizes existing values to create a unique key for thedocuments being indexed.During incremental indexing, where new and updated content is indexed, incomingdocuments with new keys are added, while incoming documents with existing keys areeither merged or overwritten, depending on whether index fields are null or populated.Use this checklist to assist the design decisions for your search index.1.\r\nReview naming conventions so that index and field names conform to the namingrules.2. Review supported data types. The data type affects how the field is used. Forexample, numeric content is filterable but not full text searchable. The mostcommon data type is Edm.String for searchable text, which is tokenized andqueried using the full text search engine. 3. Identify a document key. A document key is an index requirement. It\u0027s a singlestring field and it\u0027s populated from a source data field that contains unique values.For example, if you\u0027re indexing from Blob Storage, the metadata storage path isoften used as the document key because it uniquely identifies each blob in thecontainer.\n"
