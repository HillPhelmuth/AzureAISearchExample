The api-version is a required.\r\nRequest header composition includes two elements: Content-Type and the api-keyused to authenticate to Azure AI Search. The api-key is specified as variable, and it\u0027salso required.For the requests to succeed, you\u0027ll need to provide the service name and api-key ascollection variables.1.

Each document must have these fields,and each field must have a data type. String fields are used in full text search. If youneed numeric data to be searchable, you\u0027ll need to cast numeric data as strings.Attributes on the field determine allowed action. The REST APIs allow many actions bydefault. For example, all strings are searchable, retrievable, filterable, and facetable bydefault. Often, you only have to set attributes when you need to turn off a behavior.JSONWhen you submit this request, you should get an HTTP 201 response, indicating theindex was created successfully.\n"
