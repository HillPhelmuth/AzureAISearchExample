Under certain circumstances, the cache becomes invalid,requiring an indexer reset and run, should you choose to reload it. Next stepsIncremental enrichment is a powerful feature that extends change tracking to skillsetsand AI enrichment. Incremental enrichment enables reuse of existing processed contentas you iterate over skillset design. As a next step, enable caching on your indexers.Enable caching for incremental enrichmentSkillset concepts in Azure Cognitive SearchArticle\u202208/08/2023This article is for developers who need a deeper understanding of skillset concepts and composition,and assumes familiarity with the high-level concepts of AI enrichment.A skillset is a reusable resource in Azure Cognitive Search that\u0027s attached to an indexer.\n"
