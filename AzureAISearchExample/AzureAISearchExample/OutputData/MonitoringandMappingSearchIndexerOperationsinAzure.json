Implicit field mappings are internaland occur when field names and data types are compatible between the source anddestination.\r\nIf inputs and outputs don\u0027t match, you can define explicit field mappings to set up thedata path, as described in this article. Field mappings can also be used to introducelight-weight data conversion, such as encoding or decoding, through mappingfunctions. If more processing is required, consider Azure Data Factory to bridge the gap.\r\nField mappings apply to:Physical data structures on both sides of the data stream (between a supporteddata source and a search index). If you\u0027re importing skill-enriched content thatresides in memory, use outputFieldMappings instead.Search indexes only. If you\u0027re populating a knowledge store, use projections fordata path configuration.\r\nTop-level search fields only, where the \u0022targetFieldName\u0022 is either a simple field ora collection. A target field can\u0027t be a complex type.\uFF17 NoteIf you\u0027re working with complex data (nested or hierarchical structures), and you\u0027dlike to mirror that data structure in your search index, your search index mustmatch the source structure exactly (same field names, levels, and types) so that thedefault mappings will work. Optionally, you might want just a few nodes in thecomplex structure. To get individual nodes, you can flatten incoming data into astring collection (see outputFieldMappings for this workaround).Supported scenariosUse-caseDescriptionNamediscrepancySuppose your data source has a field named _city.\nGiven that Azure CognitiveSearch doesn\u0027t allow field names that start with an underscore, a field mapping letsyou effectively map \u0022_city\u0022 to \u0022city\u0022.If your indexing requirements include retrieving content from multiple data sources,where field names vary among the sources, you could use a field mapping to clarifythe path.\n"
