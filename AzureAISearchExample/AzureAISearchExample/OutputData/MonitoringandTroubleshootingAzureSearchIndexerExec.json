The indexer will run in full,refreshing all documents, and not just those with newer timestamps.Monitor using Azure portalYou can select on an indexer in the list to see more details about the indexer\u0027s currentand recent runs.The Indexer summary chart displays a graph of the number of documents processed inits most recent runs.\r\nThe Execution details list shows up to 50 of the most recent execution results. Select onan execution result in the list to see specifics about that run. This includes its start andend times, and any errors and warnings that occurred.If there were document-specific problems during the run, they\u0027ll be listed in the Errorsand Warnings fields.Warnings are common with some types of indexers, and don\u0027t always indicate aproblem. For example indexers that use Cognitive Services can report warnings whenimage or PDF files don\u0027t contain any text to process.For more information about investigating indexer errors and warnings, see Indexertroubleshooting guidance.\r\nCognitive Search is a monitored resource in Azure Monitor, which means that you canuse Metrics Explorer to see basic metrics about the number of indexer-processedMonitor with Azure Monitoring Metricsdocuments and skill invocations. These metrics can be used to monitor indexer progressand set up alerts.Metric views can be filtered or split up by a set of predefined dimensions.
