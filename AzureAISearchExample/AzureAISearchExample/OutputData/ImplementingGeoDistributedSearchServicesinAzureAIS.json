  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfAzure AI Search doesn\u0027t provide an automated method of replicating search indexesacross geographic regions, but there are some techniques that can make this processsimple to implement and manage. These techniques are outlined in the next fewsections.The goal of a geo-distributed set of search services is to have two or more indexesavailable in two or more regions, where a user is routed to the Azure AI Search servicethat provides the lowest latency:You can implement this architecture by creating multiple services and designing astrategy for data synchronization. Optionally, you can include a resource like AzureTraffic Manager for routing requests.\r\nThere are two options for keeping two or more distinct search services in sync:Pull content updates into a search index by using an indexer.Push content into an index using the Add or Update Documents (REST) API or anAzure SDK equivalent API.To configure either option, we recommend using the sample Bicep script in the azure-search-multiple-region repository, modified to your regions and indexing strategies.\r\nIf you\u0027re already using indexer on one service, you can configure a second indexer on asecond service to use the same data source object, pulling data from the same location.Each service in each region has its own indexer and a target index (your search indexisn\u0027t shared, which means each index has its own copy of the data), but each indexerreferences the same data source. Here\u0027s a high-level visual of what that architecture would look like.\uEA80 TipFor help in deploying multiple search services across multiple regions, see thisBicep sample on GitHub that deploys a fully configured, multi-regional searchsolution. The sample gives you two options for index synchronization, and requestredirection using Traffic Manager.Synchronize data across multiple servicesOption 1: Use indexers for updating content on multiple servicesIf you\u0027re using the Azure AI Search REST API to push content to your search index, youcan keep your various search services in sync by pushing changes to all search serviceswhenever an update is required.\n"
