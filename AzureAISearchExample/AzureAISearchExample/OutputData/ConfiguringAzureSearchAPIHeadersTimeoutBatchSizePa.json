  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfAllowed methods are PUTor POSThttpHeadersA collection of key-value pairs where the keys represent header namesand values represent header values that will be sent to your Web APIalong with the payload. The following headers are prohibited from beingin this collection: Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Content-Length, Content-Type, Cookie, Host, TE, Upgrade, Via.\r\ntimeout(Optional) When specified, indicates the timeout for the http client makingthe API call. It must be formatted as an XSD \u0022dayTimeDuration\u0022 value (arestricted subset of an ISO 8601 duration value). For example, PT60S for60 seconds. If not set, a default value of 30 seconds is chosen.\r\nThe timeoutcan be set to a maximum of 230 seconds and a minimum of 1 second.batchSize(Optional) Indicates how many \u0022data records\u0022 (see JSON payload structurebelow) will be sent per API call. If not set, a default of 1000 is chosen. Werecommend that you make use of this parameter to achieve a suitabletradeoff between indexing throughput and load on your API.\r\ndegreeOfParallelism(Optional) When specified, indicates the number of calls the indexer willmake in parallel to the endpoint you have provided. You can decrease thisvalue if your endpoint is failing under pressure, or raise it if your endpointcan handle the load. If not set, a default value of 5 is used. ThedegreeOfParallelism can be set to a maximum of 10 and a minimum of 1. There are no predefined inputs for this skill. The inputs are any existing field, or anynode in the enrichment tree that you want to pass to your custom skill.Skill inputsSkill outputsThere are no predefined outputs for this skill. Be sure to define an output field mappingin the indexer if the skill\u0027s output should be sent to a field in the search index.\n"
