Service-managed encryption applies to both long-term data storage andtemporary data storage.Optionally, you can add customer-managed keys (CMK) for supplemental encryption ofindexed content for double encryption of data at rest.\r\nFor services created after August1 2020, CMK encryption extends to short-term data on temporary disks.In Azure AI Search, encryption starts with connections and transmissions. For searchservices on the public internet, Azure AI Search listens on HTTPS port 443. All client-to-service connections use TLS 1.2 encryption. Earlier versions (1.0 or 1.1) aren\u0027t supported.For data handled internally by the search service, the following table describes the dataencryption models. Some features, such as knowledge store, incremental enrichment,and indexer-based indexing, read from or write to data structures in other AzureServices.\r\nServices that have a dependency on Azure Storage can use the encryptionfeatures of that technology.ModelKeys\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Requirements\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0RestrictionsApplies toserver-sideencryptionMicrosoft-managedkeysNone (built-in)None, available onall tiers, in allregions, for contentcreated after January24, 2018.
