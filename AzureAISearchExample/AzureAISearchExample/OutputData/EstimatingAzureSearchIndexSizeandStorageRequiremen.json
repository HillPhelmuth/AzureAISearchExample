  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfIts size will be based on imported data, text analysis,and index configuration such as whether you enable suggesters, filtering, and sorting.For full text search, the primary data structure is an inverted index structure, which hasdifferent characteristics than source data. For an inverted index, size and complexity aredetermined by content, not necessarily by the amount of data that you feed into it. Alarge data source with high redundancy could result in a smaller index than a smallerdataset that contains highly variable content. So it\u0027s rarely possible to infer index sizebased on the size of the original dataset.\r\nAttributes on the index, such as enabling filters and sorting, will impact storagerequirements. The use of suggesters also has storage implications. For moreinformation, see Attributes and index size.Approaching estimation\uFF17 NoteEven though estimating future needs for indexes and storage can feel likeguesswork, it\u0027s worth doing.\r\nIf a tier\u0027s capacity turns out to be too low, you\u0027ll needto provision a new service at a higher tier and then reload your indexes. There\u0027s noin-place upgrade of a service from one tier to another.One approach for estimating capacity is to start with the Free tier. Remember that theFree service offers up to three indexes, 50 MB of storage, and 2 minutes of indexingtime.\r\nIt can be challenging to estimate a projected index size with these constraints, butthese are the steps:Create a free service.Prepare a small, representative dataset.Create an index and load your data. If the dataset can be hosted in an Azure datasource supported by indexers, you can use the Import data wizard in the portal toboth create and load the index. Otherwise, you could use REST and Postman tocreate the index and push the data. The push model requires data to be in theform of JSON documents, where fields in the document correspond to fields in theindex.Collect information about the index, such as size. Features and attributes have animpact on storage.\nFor example, adding suggesters (search-as-you-type queries)will increase storage requirements.Using the same data set, you might try creating multiple versions of an index, withdifferent attributes on each field, to see how storage requirements vary. For moreinformation, see \u0022Storage implications\u0022 in Create a basic index.\n"
