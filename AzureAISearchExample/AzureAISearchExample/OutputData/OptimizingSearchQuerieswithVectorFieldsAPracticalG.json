The dimensions attribute has aminimum of 2 and a maximum of 2048 floating point values each. This quickstartsets the dimensions attribute to 1536 because that\u0027s the size of embeddingsgenerated by the Open AI\u0027s text-embedding-ada-002 model.Use the Search POST REST API for query request.\r\nThere are several queries to demonstrate various patterns.Single vector searchSingle vector search with filterHybrid searchSemantic hybrid search with filterThe queries in this section are based on two strings:search string: \u0022historic hotel walk to restaurants and shopping\u0022vector query string (vectorized into a mathematical representation): \u0022classic lodgingnear running trails, eateries, retail\u0022The vector query string is semantically similar to the search string, but has terms thatdon\u0027t exist in the search index. If you do a keyword search for \u0022classic lodging nearrunning trails, eateries, retail\u0022, results are zero. We use this example to show how youcan get relevant results even if there are no matching terms.\nIn this vector query, which is shortened for brevity, the \u0022value\u0022 contains the vectorizedtext of the query input, \u0022fields\u0022 determines which vector fields are searched, and \u0022k\u0022specifies the number of nearest neighbors to return.The vector query string is \u0022classic lodging near running trails, eateries, retail\u0022 - vectorizedinto 1536 embeddings for this query.\n"
