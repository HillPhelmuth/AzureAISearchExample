The shape of this document is described in theindex using Fields. Each Field has a name, a datatype, and additional metadata such asif it is searchable or filterable.Typically you will only wish to show a subset of search results to a user at one time.\r\nTosupport this, you can use the top, skip and includeTotalCount parameters to provide apaged experience on top of search results.Supported data types in an index are mapped to JSON types in API requests/responses.The JS client library keeps these mostly the same, with some exceptions:Edm.DateTimeOffset is converted to a JS Date.Edm. GeographyPoint is converted to a GeographyPoint type exported by the clientlibrary.Special values of the number type (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity) are serialized as strings inthe REST API, but are converted back to number by the client library.Note: Data types are converted based on value, not the field type in the index schema.\n"
