  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfA search service will balance indexing and queryworkloads, but if query latency is too high, you can either add capacity or identifyperiods of low query activity for loading an index.A search service accepts JSON documents that conform to the index schema.You can prepare these documents yourself, but if content resides in a supported datasource, running an indexer or the Import data wizard can automate document retrieval,JSON serialization, and indexing.\r\nUsing Azure portal, the sole means for loading an index is an indexer or running theImport Data wizard. The wizard creates objects. If you want to load an existingindex, you\u0027ll need to use an alternative approach.1. Sign in to the Azure portal with your Azure account.\r\n2. Find your search service and on the Overview page, select Import data onthe command bar to create and populate a search index. You can follow thisLoad documentsAzure portallink to review the workflow: Quickstart: Create an Azure Cognitive Searchindex in the Azure portal.3.\r\nAlternatively, you can reset and run an indexer, which is useful if you\u0027re addingfields incrementally. Reset forces the indexer to start over, picking up all fieldsfrom all source documents.Azure Cognitive Search supports document-level operations so that you can look up,update, and delete a specific document in isolation. The following example shows howto delete a document.\r\nIn a search service, documents are unrelated so deleting one willhave no impact on the rest of the index.1. Identify which field is the document key. In the portal, you can view the fields ofeach index. Document keys are string fields and are denoted with a key icon tomake them easier to spot.2. Check the values of the document key field: search=*\u0026$select=HotelId. A simplestring is straightforward, but if the index uses a base-64 encoded field, or if searchdocuments were generated from a parsingMode setting, you might be workingwith values that you aren\u0027t familiar with.3. Look up the document to verify the value of the document ID and to review itscontent before deleting it.\n"
