  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfBasic provides dedicated computing resources for production workloads at a smallerscale, but shares some networking infrastructure with other tenants.Standard runs on dedicated machines with more storage and processing capacity at everylevel. Standard comes in four levels: S1, S2, S3, and S3 HD. S3 High Density (S3 HD) isengineered for multi-tenancy and large quantities of small indexes (three thousandindexes per service).\r\nS3 HD doesn\u0027t provide the indexer feature and data ingestion mustuse APIs that push data from source to index.Storage Optimized runs on dedicated machines with more total storage, storagebandwidth, and memory than Standard. This tier targets large, slow-changing indexes.Storage Optimized comes in two levels: L1 and L2.\r\nYou can create multiple billable search services (Basic and higher), limited only by the numberof services allowed at each tier. For example, you could create up to 16 services at the Basic tierand another 16 services at the S1 tier within the same subscription. For more information abouttiers, see Choose an SKU or tier for Azure AI Search.\r\nMaximum service limits can be raised upon request.

The free tier is based oninfrastructure that\u0027s shared with other customers. Because the hardware isn\u0027t dedicated, scale-up isn\u0027t supported, and storage is limited to 50 MB. Search units are billing units, allocated as either a replica or a partition. You need bothresources for storage, indexing, and query operations.\n"
