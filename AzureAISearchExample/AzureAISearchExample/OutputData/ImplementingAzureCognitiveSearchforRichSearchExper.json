To populate anindex, you can push JSON documents that contain your content, or if your data isalready in Azure, create an indexer to pull in data automatically.Attach skillsets to an indexer to create searchable content from images and largetext documents. A skillset leverages AI from Cognitive Services for built-in OCR,entity recognition, key phrase extraction, language detection, text translation, andsentiment analysis. You can also add custom skills to integrate external processingof your content during data ingestion.In a search client application, implement query logic and user experiences similarto commercial web search engines.\n"
