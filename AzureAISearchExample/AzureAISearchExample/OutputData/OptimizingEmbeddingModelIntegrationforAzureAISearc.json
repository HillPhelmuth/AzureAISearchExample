To support hybrid queries that include semantic ranking, or if you want to trymachine learning model integration using a custom skill in an AI enrichmentpipeline, note the regions that provide those features.The Postman collection assumes that you already have a vector query. Here\u0027s somePython code for generating an embedding that you can paste into the \u0022values\u0022 propertyof a vector query.PythonIdentify use cases: Evaluate the specific use cases where embedding modelintegration for vector search features can add value to your search solution.\r\nThiscan include matching image content with text content, cross-lingual searches, orfinding similar documents.Generate an embedding for an improvisedquery!pip install openai==0.28.1import openaiopenai.api_type = \u0022azure\u0022openai.api_key = \u0022YOUR-API-KEY\u0022openai.api_base = \u0022https://YOUR-OPENAI-RESOURCE.openai.azure.com\u0022openai.api_version = \u00222023-05-15\u0022response = openai.Embedding.\r\ncreate(    input=\u0022How do I use Python in VSCode?\u0022,    engine=\u0022text-embedding-ada-002\u0022)embeddings = response[\u0027data\u0027][0][\u0027embedding\u0027]print(embeddings)Tips and recommendations for embeddingmodel integrationOptimize cost and performance: Vector search can be resource-intensive and issubject to maximum limits, so consider only vectorizing the fields that containsemantic meaning. Choose the right embedding model: Select an appropriate model for your specificuse case, such as word embeddings for text-based searches or image embeddingsfor visual searches. Consider using pretrained models like text-embedding-ada-002 from OpenAI or Image Retrieval REST API from Azure AI Computer Vision.Normalize Vector lengths: Ensure that the vector lengths are normalized beforestoring them in the search index to improve the accuracy and performance ofsimilarity search. Most pretrained models already are normalized but not all.Fine-tune the model: If needed, fine-tune the selected model on your domain-specific data to improve its performance and relevance to your search application.\n"
