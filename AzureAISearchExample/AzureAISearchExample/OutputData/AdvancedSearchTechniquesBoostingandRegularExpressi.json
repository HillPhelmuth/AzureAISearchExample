  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfTo boost a term, use the caret, ^, symbol with a boost factor (a number) at the end ofthe term you\u0027re searching. You can also boost phrases. The higher the boost factor, themore relevant the term is relative to other search terms. By default, the boost factor is 1.Although the boost factor must be positive, it can be less than 1 (for example, 0.20).\r\nA regular expression search finds a match based on patterns that are valid under ApacheLucene, as documented in the RegExp class. In Azure Cognitive Search, a regularexpression is enclosed between forward slashes /.For example, to find documents containing motel or hotel, specify /[mh]otel/. Regularexpression searches are matched against single words.\r\nSome tools and languages impose other escape character requirements. For JSON,strings that include a forward slash are escaped with a backward slash:microsoft.com/azure/ becomes search=/.*microsoft.com\\/azure\\/.*/ where search=/.*\u003Cstring-placeholder\u003E.*/ sets up the regular expression, and microsoft.\r\ncom\\/azure\\/ isthe string with an escaped forward slash.Two common symbols in regex queries are . and *. A . matches any one characterand a * matches the previous character zero or more times. For example, /be./matches the terms bee and bet while /be*/ would match be, bee, and beee but notTerm boostingRegular expression searchbet. Together, . * allow you to match any series of characters so /be.*/ would matchany term that starts with be such as better.You can use generally recognized syntax for multiple (*) or single (?) character wildcardsearches. Full Lucene syntax supports prefix, infix, and suffix matching.Note the Lucene query parser supports the use of these symbols with a single term, andnot a phrase.\n"
