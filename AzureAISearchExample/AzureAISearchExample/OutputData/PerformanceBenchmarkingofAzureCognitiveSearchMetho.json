  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfTo benchmark Azure Cognitive Search\u0027s performance, we ran tests for two differentscenarios at different tiers and replica/partition combinations.To create these benchmarks, the following methodology was used:1. The test begins at X queries per second (QPS) for 180 seconds. This was usually 5or 10 QPS.2. QPS then increased by X and ran for another 180 seconds3.\r\nEvery 180 seconds, the test increased by X QPS until average latency increasedabove 1000 ms or less than 99% of queries succeeded.The following graph gives a visual example of what the test\u0027s query load looks like:Testing methodologyEach scenario used at least 10,000 unique queries to avoid tests being overly skewed bycaching.\r\nMaximum QPS - the maximum QPS numbers are based on the highest QPSachieved in a test where 99% of queries completed successfully without throttlingand average latency stayed under 1000 ms.Percentage of max QPS - A percentage of the maximum QPS achieved for aparticular test. For example, if a given test reached a maximum of 100 QPS, 20% ofmax QPS would be 20 QPS.\r\nLatency - The server\u0027s latency for a query; these numbers don\u0027t include round tripdelay (RTT). Values are in milliseconds (ms).The code we used to run these benchmarks is available on the azure-search-performance-testing repository. It\u0027s worth noting that we observed slightly lower QPS\uFF09 ImportantThese tests only include query workloads. If you expect to have a high volume ofindexing operations, be sure to factor that into your estimation and performancetesting. Sample code for simulating indexing can be found in this tutorial.DefinitionsDisclaimerlevels with the JMeter performance testing solution than in the benchmarks. Thedifferences can be attributed to differences in the style of the tests. This speaks to theimportance of making your performance tests as similar to your production workload aspossible.These benchmarks in no way guarantee a certain level of performance from your servicebut can give you an idea of the performance you can expect based on your scenario.\n"
