  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfAll services are initially provisioned at one SU, but you can increase the SUs byadding either partitions or replicas to handle larger workloads. For more information, see How toestimate costs of a search service.There is no built-in support to upgrade or downgrade tiers. If you want to switch to a different tier, theapproach is:Create a new search service at the new tier.\r\nDeploy your search content onto the new service.

Basic provides dedicated computing resources for production workloads at a smallerscale, but shares some networking infrastructure with other tenants.Standard runs on dedicated machines with more storage and processing capacity at everylevel. Standard comes in four levels: S1, S2, S3, and S3 HD. S3 High Density (S3 HD) isengineered for multi-tenancy and large quantities of small indexes (three thousandindexes per service).\n"
