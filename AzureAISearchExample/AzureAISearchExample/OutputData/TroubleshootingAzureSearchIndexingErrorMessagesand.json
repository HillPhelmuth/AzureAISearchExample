Use GeoJsonpoint literals insteadIn all these cases, refer to Supported Data types and Data type map for indexers tomake sure that you build the index schema correctly and have set up appropriateindexer field mappings.\r\nThe error message includes details that can help track down thesource of the mismatch.This applies to SQL tables, and usually happens when the key is either defined as acomposite key or, when the table has defined a unique clustered index (as in a SQLindex, not an Azure Search index).\r\nThe main reason is that the key attribute is modifiedto be a composite primary key in the case of a unique clustered index. In that case,make sure that your SQL table doesn\u0027t have a unique clustered index, or that you mapthe key field to a field that is guaranteed not to have duplicate values.Error: Integrated change tracking policycannot be used because table has a compositeprimary keyThis error occurs when the indexer is unable to finish processing a single documentfrom the data source within the allowed execution time. Maximum running time isshorter when skillsets are used. When this error occurs, if you have maxFailedItems setto a value other than 0, the indexer bypasses the document on future runs so thatindexing can progress. If you can\u0027t afford to skip any document, or if you\u0027re seeing thiserror consistently, consider breaking documents into smaller documents so that partialprogress can be made within a single indexer execution.\n"
