For more information about filter scenarios, see Filters in Azure AISearch.\r\nA filter in the OData language is a Boolean expression, which in turn can be one ofseveral types of expression, as shown by the following EBNF (Extended Backus-NaurForm):An interactive syntax diagram is also available:The types of Boolean expressions include:Syntaxboolean_expression ::=    collection_filter_expression    | logical_expression    | comparison_expression    | boolean_literal    | boolean_function_call    | \u0027(\u0027 boolean_expression \u0027)\u0027    | variable/* This can be a range variable in the case of a lambda, or a field path. */variable ::= identifier | field_pathOData syntax diagram for Azure AI Search\uFF17 NoteSee OData expression syntax reference for Azure AI Search for the completeEBNF.Collection filter expressions using any or all. These apply filter criteria tocollection fields.\n"
