If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phraseextractor, consider using the Text Split skill.\r\nIf you do use a text split skill, set the pagelength to 5000 for the best performance.\uFF09 ImportantThe Entity Recognition skill (v2) (Microsoft.Skills.Text.EntityRecognitionSkill) is nowdiscontinued replaced by Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityRecognitionSkill.

Charges accrue when calling APIs in Azure AI services, and forimage extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure Cognitive Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents.Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing Azure AI services pay-as-yougo price.
