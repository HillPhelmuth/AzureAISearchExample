  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfIndexesAn index is stored on your search service and populated with JSON documents thatare indexed and tokenized for information retrieval. The fields collection of an indexdefines the structure of the search document. Fields have a name, data types, andattributes that determine how it\u0027s used. For example, searchable fields are used infull text search, and thus tokenized during indexing. An index also defines otherconstructs, such as scoring profiles for relevance tuning, suggesters, semanticconfigurations, and custom analyzers.IndexersIndexers provide indexing automation.\r\nAn indexer connects to a data source, readsin the data, and passes it to a search engine for indexing into a target search index.Indexers read from an external source using connection information in a datasource, and serialize the incoming data into JSON search documents. In addition toa data source, an indexer also requires an index. The index specifies the fields andattributes of the search documents.SkillsetsA skillset adds external processing steps to indexer execution, and is usually used toadd AI or deep learning models to analyze or transform content to make itsearchable in an index.\r\nThe contents of a skillset are one or more skills, which canbe built-in skills created by Microsoft, custom skills, or a combination of both. Built-in skills exist for image analysis, including OCR, and natural language processing.Other examples of built-in skills include entity recognition, key phrase extraction,chunking text into logical pages, among others.\r\nA skillset is high-level standaloneobject that exists on a level equivalent to indexes, indexers, and data sources, butit\u0027s operational only within indexer processing. As a high-level object, you candesign a skillset once, and then reference it in multiple indexers.SynonymmapsA synonym map is service-level object that contains user-defined synonyms. Thisobject is maintained independently from search indexes. Once uploaded, you canpoint any searchable field to the synonym map (one per field).You can use key-based authentication or role-based through Microsoft Entra ID.Key-based authentication relies on API keys that are generated for the searchservice. Having a valid key establishes trust, on a per request basis, between theapplication sending the request and the service that handles it.\n"
