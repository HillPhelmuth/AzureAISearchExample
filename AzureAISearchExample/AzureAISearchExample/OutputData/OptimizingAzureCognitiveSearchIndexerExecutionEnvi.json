There are twoenvironments. If you\u0027re using an IP firewall to control access to Azure resources,knowing about execution environments will help you set up an IP range that is inclusiveof both.For any given indexer run, Azure Cognitive Search determines the best environment inwhich to run the indexer. Depending on the number and types of tasks assigned, theindexer will run in one of two environments:A private execution environment that\u0027s internal to a search service.Indexers running in the private environment share computing resources with otherindexing and query workloads on the same search service. Typically, only indexersthat perform text-based indexing (without skillsets) run in this environment.\n"
