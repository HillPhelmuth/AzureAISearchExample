  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfTo disable the ORDER BY clause, usethe disableOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn setting in the indexer definition:HTTPWhen rows are deleted from the source table, you probably want to delete those rowsfrom the search index as well.\r\nIf you use the SQL integrated change tracking policy, thisis taken care of for you. However, the high water mark change tracking policy doesn\u2019thelp you with deleted rows. What to do?If the rows are physically removed from the table, Azure AI Search has no way to inferthe presence of records that no longer exist.\r\nHowever, you can use the \u201Csoft-delete\u201Dtechnique to logically delete rows without removing them from the table. Add a columnto your table or view and mark rows as deleted using that column.When using the soft-delete technique, you can specify the soft delete policy as followswhen creating or updating the data source:HTTPdisableOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn    {     .\r\n.. other indexer definition properties     \u0022parameters\u0022 : {            \u0022configuration\u0022 : { \u0022disableOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn\u0022 : true } }    }Soft Delete Column Deletion Detection policy    {        \u2026,        \u0022dataDeletionDetectionPolicy\u0022 : {           \u0022@odata.type\u0022 : \u0022#Microsoft.Azure.Search.\r\nSoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy\u0022,           \u0022softDeleteColumnName\u0022 : \u0022[a column name]\u0022,           \u0022softDeleteMarkerValue\u0022 : \u0022[the value that indicates that a row is deleted]\u0022        }    }The softDeleteMarkerValue must be a string in the JSON representation of your datasource. Use the string representation of your actual value. For example, if you have aninteger column where deleted rows are marked with the value 1, use \u00221\u0022. If you have aBIT column where deleted rows are marked with the Boolean true value, use the stringliteral \u0022True\u0022 or \u0022true\u0022, the case doesn\u0027t matter.\n"
