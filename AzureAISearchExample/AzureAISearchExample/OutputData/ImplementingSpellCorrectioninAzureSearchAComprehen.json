Spell check works on strings passed in the search parameter. It\u0027s notsupported for filters, fuzzy search, wildcard search, regular expressions, or vectorqueries.Use a search client that supports preview APIs on the query request.\r\nFor REST, you canuse Postman, another web client, or code that you\u0027ve modified to make REST calls to thepreview APIs.

Without spell correction, the query returns zeroresults. With correction, the query returns one result for Johnson\u0027s family-orientedresort. HTTPSpelling correction occurs on individual query terms that undergo text analysis, which iswhy you can use the speller parameter with some Lucene queries, but not others.Incompatible query forms that bypass text analysis include: wildcard, regex, fuzzyCompatible query forms include: fielded search, proximity, term boostingThis example uses fielded search over the Category field, with full Lucene syntax, and amisspelled query term.\nBy including speller, the typo in \u0022Suiite\u0022 is corrected and thequery succeeds.HTTPSpell correction with simple searchPOST https://[service name].search.windows.\n"
