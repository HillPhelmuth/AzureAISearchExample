To preventaccidental deletions, you can lock resources.\r\nNext stepsManage your Azure AI Search servicewith PowerShellArticle\u202211/15/2023You can run PowerShell cmdlets and scripts on Windows, Linux, or in Azure Cloud Shellto create and configure Azure AI Search. The Az.Search module extends AzurePowerShell with full parity to the Search Management REST APIs and the ability toperform the following tasks:Occasionally, questions are asked about tasks not on the above list.\r\nYou cannot change a server name, region, or tier programmatically or in the portal.Dedicated resources are allocated when a service is created. As such, changing theunderlying hardware (location or node type) requires a new service.You cannot use tools or APIs to transfer content, such as an index, from one service toanother. Within a service, programmatic creation of content is through Search ServiceREST API or an SDK such as Azure SDK for .NET. While there are no dedicatedcommands for content migration, you can write script that calls REST API or a clientlibrary to create and load indexes on a new service.Preview administration features are typically not available in the Az.Search module. Ifyou want to use a preview feature, use the Management REST API and a preview APIversion.The examples in this article are interactive and require elevated permissions. LocalPowerShell and the Azure PowerShell (the Az module) are required.\n"
