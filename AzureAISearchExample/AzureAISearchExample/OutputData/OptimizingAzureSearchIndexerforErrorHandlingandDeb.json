  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfYour container name in the indexer is correct.Sometimes a small failure stops an indexer in its tracks. That is fine if you plan to fixissues one by one. However, you might want to ignore a particular type of error,Tip 1: Start with a small datasetTip 2: Make sure your data source credentialsare correctTip 3: See what works even if there are somefailuresallowing the indexer to continue so that you can see what flows are actually working.\r\nIn that case, you may want to tell the indexer to ignore errors. Do that by settingmaxFailedItems and maxFailedItemsPerBatch as -1 as part of the indexer definition.Debug sessions is a visual editor that works with an existing skillset in the Azure portal.\r\nWithin a debug session you can identify and resolve errors, validate changes, andcommit changes to a production skillset in the AI enrichment pipeline. This is a previewfeature read the documentation. For more information about concepts and gettingstarted, see Debug sessions.Debug sessions work on a single document are a great way for you to iteratively buildmore complex enrichment pipelines.Enriched documents are temporary structures created during enrichment, and thendeleted when processing is complete.To capture a snapshot of the enriched document created during indexing, add a fieldcalled enriched to your index.\r\nThe indexer automatically dumps into the field a string{   \u0022// rest of your indexer definition    \u0022parameters\u0022:    {       \u0022maxFailedItems\u0022:-1,       \u0022maxFailedItemsPerBatch\u0022:-1   } } \uFF17 NoteAs a best practice, set the maxFailedItems, maxFailedItemsPerBatch to 0 forproduction workloadsTip 4: Use Debug sessions to identify andresolve issues with your skillsetTip 5: Looking at enriched documents underthe hoodrepresentation of all the enrichments for that document. The enriched field will contain a string that is a logical representation of the in-memoryenriched document in JSON. The field value is a valid JSON document, however. Quotesare escaped so you\u0027ll need to replace \\\u0022 with \u0022 in order to view the document asformatted JSON.\n"
