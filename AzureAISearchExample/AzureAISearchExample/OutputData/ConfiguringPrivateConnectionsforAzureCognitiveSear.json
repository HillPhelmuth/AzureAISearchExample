The object created for theconnection is called a shared private link. On the connection, Search uses the sharedprivate link internally to reach an Azure PaaS resource inside the network boundary.Shared private link is a premium feature that\u0027s billed by usage.\r\nWhen you set up ashared private link, charges for the private endpoint are added to your Azure invoice. Asyou use the shared private link, data transfer rates for inbound and outbound access arealso invoiced. For details, see Azure Private Link pricing. Cognitive Search makes outbound calls to other Azure PaaS resources in the followingscenarios:Indexer connection requests to supported data sourcesIndexer (skillset) connections to Azure Storage for caching enrichments or writingto a knowledge storeEncryption key requests to Azure Key VaultCustom skill requests to Azure Functions or similar resourceIn service-to-service communications, Search typically sends a request over a publicinternet connection.\n"
