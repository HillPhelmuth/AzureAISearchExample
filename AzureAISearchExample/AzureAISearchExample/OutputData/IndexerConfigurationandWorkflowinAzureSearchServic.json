In this respect, someaspects of indexer or data source configuration will vary by indexer type. However, allindexers share the same basic composition and requirements. Steps that are common toall indexers are covered below.\r\n\uF80ABasic workflowStep 1: Create a data sourceIndexers require a data source object that provides a connection string and possiblycredentials. Data sources are independent objects. Multiple indexers can use the samedata source object to load more than one index at a time.You can create a data source using any of these approaches:Using the Azure portal, on the Data sources tab of your search service pages,select Add data source to specify the data source definition.Using the Azure portal, the Import data wizard outputs a data source.Using the REST APIs, call Create Data Source.Using the Azure SDK for .\r\nNET, call SearchIndexerDataSourceConnection classAn indexer will automate some tasks related to data ingestion, but creating an index isgenerally not one of them. As a prerequisite, you must have a predefined index thatcontains corresponding target fields for any source fields in your external data source.Fields need to match by name and data type.\r\nIf not, you can define field mappings toestablish the association.For more information, see Create an index.An indexer definition consists of properties that uniquely identify the indexer, specifywhich data source and index to use, and provide other configuration options thatinfluence run time behaviors, including whether the indexer runs on demand or on aschedule. Any errors or warnings about data access or skillset validation will occur during indexerexecution. Until indexer execution starts, dependent objects such as data sources,indexes, and skillsets are passive on the search service.For more information, see Create an indexerAfter the first indexer run, you can rerun it on demand or set up a schedule.\n"
