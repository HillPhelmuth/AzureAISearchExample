  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThedifferences can be attributed to differences in the style of the tests. This speaks to theimportance of making your performance tests as similar to your production workload aspossible.These benchmarks in no way guarantee a certain level of performance from your servicebut can give you an idea of the performance you can expect based on your scenario.\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us atazuresearch_contact@microsoft.com.This benchmark was created in partnership with the e-commerce company, CDON, theNordic region\u0027s largest online marketplace with operations in Sweden, Finland, Norway,and Denmark. Through its 1,500 merchants, CDON offers a wide range assortment thatincludes over 8 million products.\r\nIn 2020, CDON had over 120 million visitors and 2million active customers. You can learn more about CDON\u0027s use of Azure CognitiveSearch in this article.To run these tests, we used a snapshot of CDON\u0027s production search index andthousands of unique queries from their website.\r\nDocument Count: 6,000,000Index Size: 20 GBIndex Schema: a wide index with 250 fields total, 25 searchable fields, and 200facetable/filterable fieldsQuery Types: full text search queries including facets, filters, ordering, and scoringprofilesBenchmark 1: E-commerce searchScenario DetailsS1 PerformanceQueries per secondThe following chart shows the highest query load a service could handle for an extendedperiod of time in terms of queries per second (QPS).\r\nQuery latency varies based on the load of the service and services under higher stresswill have a higher average query latency.
