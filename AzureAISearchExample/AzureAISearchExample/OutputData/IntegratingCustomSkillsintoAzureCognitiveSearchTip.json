An output field mapping is defined in an indexer and has the followingelements:JSONIn contrast with a fieldMappings definition that maps a path between two physical datastructures, an outputFieldMappings definition maps in-memory data to fields in a searchindex.Output field mappings are required if your indexer has an attached skillset that createsnew information, such as text translation or key phrase extraction. During indexerexecution, AI-generated information exists in memory only. To persist this information ina search index, you\u0027ll need to tell the indexer where to send the data.\n"
