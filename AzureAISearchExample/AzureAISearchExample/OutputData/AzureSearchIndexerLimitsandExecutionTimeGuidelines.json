For AI indexingthat calls into Azure AI services, free services are limited to 20 free transactions per indexer perday, where a transaction is defined as a document that successfully passes through theenrichment pipeline (tip: you can reset an indexer to reset its count). Basic services created before December 2017 have lower limits (5 instead of 15) on indexers,data sources, and skillsets. S3 HD services don\u0027t include indexer support. Maximum of 30 skills per skillset. AI enrichment and image analysis are computationally intensive and consumedisproportionate amounts of available processing power. Running time for these workloads hasbeen shortened to give other jobs in the queue more opportunity to run.\nIndexer execution and combined indexer-skillset execution is subject to a 2-hour maximumduration. Currently, some indexers have a longer 24-hour maximum execution window, butthat behavior isn\u0027t the norm. The longer window only applies if a service or its indexers can\u0027t beinternally migrated to the newer runtime behavior.\n"
