You should test both thesearch query load that you expect, but also the expected data ingestion workloads (ifpossible, run both workloads simultaneously). Having benchmark numbers helps tovalidate the proper search tier, service configuration, and expected query latency.To develop benchmarks, we recommend the azure-search-performance-testing(GitHub) tool.To isolate the effects of a distributed service architecture, try testing on serviceconfigurations of one replica and one partition.The most important diagnostic tool at an administrator\u0027s disposal is resource logging.\r\nResource logging is the collection of operational data and metrics about your searchservice. Resource logging is enabled through Azure Monitor. There are costs associatedwith using Azure Monitor and storing data, but if you enable it for your service, it can beinstrumental in investigating performance issues.The following image shows the chain of events in a query request and response. Latencycan occur at any one of them, whether during a network transfer, processing of contentin the app services layer, or on a search service. A key benefit of resource logging is thatactivities are logged from the search service perspective, which means that the log canDevelop baseline numbers\uFF17 NoteFor the Storage Optimized tiers (L1 and L2), you should expect a lower querythroughput and higher latency than the Standard tiers.Use resource logginghelp you determine if the performance issue is due to problems with the query orindexing, or some other point of failure.\n"
