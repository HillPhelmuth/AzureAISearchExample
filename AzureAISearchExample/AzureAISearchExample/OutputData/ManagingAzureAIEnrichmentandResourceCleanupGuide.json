Resources left running cancost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group todelete the entire set of resources.\r\nYou can find and manage resources in the portal, using the All resources or Resourcegroups link in the left-navigation pane.If you\u0027re using a free service, remember that you\u0027re limited to three indexes, indexers,and data sources. You can delete individual items in the portal to stay under the limit.\r\nClean up\uEA80 TipIf you want to repeat this exercise or try a different AI enrichment walkthrough,delete the hotel-reviews-idxr indexer and the related objects to recreate them.Deleting the indexer resets the free daily transaction counter to zero.Next stepsNow that you\u0027ve enriched your data by using Azure AI services and projected the resultsto a knowledge store, you can use Storage Explorer or other apps to explore yourenriched data set.\r\nGet started with Storage ExplorerShaping data for projection into aknowledge storeArticle\u202201/31/2023In Azure Cognitive Search, \u0022shaping data\u0022 describes a step in the knowledge storeworkflow that creates a data representation of the content that you want to project intotables, objects, and files in Azure Storage. As skills execute, the outputs are written to an enrichment tree in a hierarchy of nodes,and while you might want to view and consume the enrichment tree in its entirety, it\u0027smore likely that you\u0027ll want a finer grain, creating subsets of nodes for differentscenarios, such as placing the nodes related to translated text or extracted entities inspecific tables.\n"
