  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfHybrid queries are useful because they add support for all query capabilities, includingorderby and semantic ranking. For example, in addition to the vector query, you couldsearch over people or product names or titles, scenarios for which similarity search isn\u0027ta good fit.The following example is from the Postman collection of REST APIs that demonstratehybrid query configurations.\r\nHTTPKey points:Hybrid query requestPOST https://{{search-service-name}}.search.windows.net/indexes/{{index-name}}/docs/search?api-version=2023-11-01Content-Type: application/jsonapi-key: {{admin-api-key}}{    \u0022vectorQueries\u0022: [{        \u0022vector\u0022: [            -0.009154141,            0.\r\n018708462,            . . .             -0.02178128,            -0.00086512347        ],        \u0022fields\u0022: \u0022contentVector\u0022,        \u0022kind\u0022: \u0022vector\u0022,        \u0022exhaustive\u0022: true,        \u0022k\u0022: 10    }],    \u0022search\u0022: \u0022what azure services support full text search\u0022,    \u0022select\u0022: \u0022title, content, category\u0022,    \u0022top\u0022: \u002210\u0022}The vector query string is specified through the vector \u0022vector.\r\nvalue\u0022 property. Thequery executes against the \u0022contentVector\u0022 field. Set \u0022kind\u0022 to \u0022vector\u0022 to indicatethe query type. Optionally, set \u0022exhaustive\u0022 to true to query the full contents of thevector field.Keyword search is specified through \u0022search\u0022 property. It executes in parallel withthe vector query. \u0022k\u0022 determines how many nearest neighbor matches are returned from the vectorquery and provided to the RRF ranker.\u0022top\u0022 determines how many matches are returned in the response all-up. In thisexample, the response includes 10 results, assuming there are at least 10 matchesin the merged results.\n"
