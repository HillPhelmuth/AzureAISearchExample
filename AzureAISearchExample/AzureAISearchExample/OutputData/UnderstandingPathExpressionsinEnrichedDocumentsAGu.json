  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdf..\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003...\u2003\u2003...All the data is under one root element, for which the path is \u0022/document\u0022. The rootelement is the default context for skills.\r\nSimple paths through the internal enriched document can be expressed with simpletokens separated by slashes. This syntax is similar to the JSON Pointer specification.The properties of nodes that represent objects add their values to the tree under theproperty\u0027s name.\r\nThose values can be obtained by appending the property name as atoken separated by a slash:ExpressionValue/document/merged_content/language\u0022en\u0022Property name tokens are case-sensitive.\r\nDocument rootSimple pathsObject propertiesArray item indexSpecific elements of an array can be referenced by using their numeric index like aproperty name:ExpressionValue/document/merged_content/keyphrases/1\u0022Syndrome\u0022/document/merged_content/entities/0/text\u0022BMN\u0022There are two characters that have special meaning and need to be escaped if theyappear in an expression and must be interpreted as is instead of as their specialmeaning: \u0027/\u0027 and \u0027~\u0027. Those characters must be escaped respectively as \u0027~0\u0027 and\u0027~1\u0027.\r\nAn array of values can be obtained using the \u0027*\u0027 token:ExpressionValue/document/normalized_images/0/text/words/*[\u0022Study\u0022, \u0022of\u0022, \u0022BMN\u0022, \u0022110\u0022 ...]The \u0027*\u0027 token doesn\u0027t have to be at the end of the path. It\u0027s possible to enumerate allnodes matching a path with a star in the middle or with multiple stars:ExpressionValue/document/normalized_images/*/text/words/*[\u0022Study\u0022, \u0022of\u0022, \u0022BMN\u0022, \u0022110\u0022 . .. \u0022it\u0022, \u0022is\u0022,\u0022certainly\u0022 ...]This example returns a flat list of all matching nodes.It\u0027s possible to maintain more structure and get a separate array for the words of eachpage by using a \u0027#\u0027 token instead of the second \u0027*\u0027 token:ExpressionValue/document/normalized_images/*/text/words/#[[\u0022Study\u0022, \u0022of\u0022, \u0022BMN\u0022, \u0022110\u0022 .\n"
