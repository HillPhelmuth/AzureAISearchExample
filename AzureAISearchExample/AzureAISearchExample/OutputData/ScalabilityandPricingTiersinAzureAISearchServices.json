In order for aservice to achieve a read-write SLA, it requires three replicas.There are a few different pricing tiers in Azure AI Search, each of the tiers has differentlimits and quotas.\r\nSome of these limits are at the service-level, some are at the index-level, and some are at the partition-level.BasicStandard1Standard2Standard3Standard3 HDMaximum Replicas perService312121212Maximum Partitions perService11212123Maximum Search Units(Replicas*Partitions) perService336363636 (max 3partitions)Maximum Storage perService2 GB300 GB1.\r\n2 TB2.4 TB600 GBMaximum Storage perPartition2 GB25 GB100 GB200 GB200 GBMaximum Indexes perService5502002003000 (max 1000indexes/partition)In Azure AI Search\u2019s S3 pricing tier, there\u0027s an option for the High Density (HD) modedesigned specifically for multitenant scenarios.
