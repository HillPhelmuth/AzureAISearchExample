The embedded video describes the technology, and the section atthe end covers availability and pricing.Semantic ranking is a premium feature, billed by usage.\r\nWe recommend this article forbackground, but if you\u0027d rather get started, follow these steps:Semantic ranking is a collection of query-related capabilities that improve the quality ofan initial BM25-ranked or RRF-ranked search result for text-based queries. When youenable it on your search service, semantic ranking extends the query execution pipelinein two ways:First, it adds secondary ranking over an initial result set that was scored usingBM25 or RRF. This secondary ranking uses multi-lingual, deep learning modelsadapted from Microsoft Bing to promote the most semantically relevant results. Second, it extracts and returns captions and answers in the response, which youcan render on a search page to improve the user\u0027s search experience.Here are the features of semantic ranking.FeatureDescriptionSemanticrankingUses the context or semantic meaning of a query to compute a new relevancescore over preranked results.Check regional availability.\uFF02Enable semantic ranking on your search service.\uFF02Create or modify queries to return semantic captions and highlights.\uFF02Add a few more query properties to also return semantic answers.\uFF02\uFF17 NoteLooking for vector support and similarity search?
