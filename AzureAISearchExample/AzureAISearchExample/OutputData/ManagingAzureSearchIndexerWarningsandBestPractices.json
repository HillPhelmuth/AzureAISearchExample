Review the warnings to understand how your data isimpacted and whether further action is required.This warning only occurs for Azure Cosmos DB data sources.\r\nIncremental progress during indexing ensures that if indexer execution is interrupted bytransient failures or execution time limit, the indexer can pick up where it left off nexttime it runs, instead of having to re-index the entire collection from scratch. This isespecially important when indexing large collections.The ability to resume an unfinished indexing job is predicated on having documentsordered by the _ts column. The indexer uses the timestamp to determine whichdocument to pick up next. If the _ts column is missing or if the indexer can\u0027t determineif a custom query is ordered by it, the indexer starts at beginning and you\u0027ll see thiswarning.\r\nIt\u0027s possible to override this behavior, enabling incremental progress and suppressingthis warning by using the assumeOrderByHighWaterMarkColumn configuration property.For more information, see Incremental progress and custom queries.The Table Storage service has limits on how large entity properties can be. Strings canhave 32,000 characters or less.\r\nIf a row with a string property longer than 32,000characters is being projected, only the first 32,000 characters are preserved. To workaround this issue, avoid projecting rows with string properties longer than 32,000characters.Warning: Web API skill response containswarningsWarning: The current indexer configurationdoes not support incremental progressWarning: Some data was lost duringprojection. Row \u0027X\u0027 in table \u0027Y\u0027 has stringproperty \u0027Z\u0027 which was too long.Indexers limit how much text can be extracted from any one document. This limitdepends on the pricing tier: 32,000 characters for Free tier, 64,000 for Basic, 4 million forStandard, 8 million for Standard S2, and 16 million for Standard S3.\n"
