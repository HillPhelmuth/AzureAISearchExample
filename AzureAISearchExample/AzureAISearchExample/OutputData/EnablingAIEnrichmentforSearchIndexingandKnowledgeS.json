  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfYou can enable an enrichment cache to persist cracked documents andskill outputs for subsequent reuse during future skillset executions.To get content into a search index, the indexer must have mapping information forsending enriched content to target field. Field mappings (explicit or implicit) setthe data path from source data to a search index. Output field mappings set thedata path from enriched documents to an index.Indexing is the process wherein raw and enriched content is ingested into thephysical data structures of a search index (its files and folders). Lexical analysis andtokenization occur in this step.Exploration is the last step.\r\nOutput is always a search index that you can query from aclient app. Output can optionally be a knowledge store consisting of blobs and tables inAzure Storage that are accessed through data exploration tools or downstreamprocesses. If you\u0027re creating a knowledge store, projections determine the data path forenriched content. The same enriched content can appear in both indexes andknowledge stores.Enrichment is useful if raw content is unstructured text, image content, or content thatneeds language detection and translation. Applying AI through the built-in skills canunlock this content for full text search and data science applications.\r\nYou can also create custom skills to provide external processing. Open-source, third-party, or first-party code can be integrated into the pipeline as a custom skill.Classification models that identify salient characteristics of various document types fallinto this category, but any external package that adds value to your content could beused.When to use AI enrichmentUse-cases for built-in skillsBuilt-in skills are based on the Azure AI services APIs: Azure AI Computer Vision andLanguage Service. Unless your content input is small, expect to attach a billable Azure AIservices resource to run larger workloads. A skillset that\u0027s assembled using built-in skills is well suited for the following applicationscenarios:Image processing skills include Optical Character Recognition (OCR) andidentification of visual features, such as facial detection, image interpretation,image recognition (famous people and landmarks), or attributes like imageorientation. These skills create text representations of image content for full textsearch in Azure AI Search.Machine translation is provided by the Text Translation skill, often paired withlanguage detection for multi-language solutions.Natural language processing analyzes chunks of text. Skills in this categoryinclude Entity Recognition, Sentiment Detection (including opinion mining), andPersonal Identifiable Information Detection.\n"
