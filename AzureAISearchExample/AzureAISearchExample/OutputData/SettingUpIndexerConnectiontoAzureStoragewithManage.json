Becausethere is no validation check, check the mappings carefully for typos so that youaren\u0027t losing documents for the wrong reason.\r\nNext stepsHow to index CSV blobs with a blob indexerTutorial: Search semi-structured data from Azure Blob StorageSet up an indexer connection to AzureStorage using a managed identityArticle\u202210/11/2023This article explains how to set up an indexer connection to an Azure Storage accountusing a managed identity instead of providing credentials in the connection string.You can use a system-assigned managed identity or a user-assigned managed identity(preview).\r\nManaged identities are Microsoft Entra logins and require Azure roleassignments to access data in Azure Storage.Create a managed identity for your search service.Assign a role in Azure Storage:Choose Storage Blob Data Reader for data read access in Blob Storage andADLS Gen2.Choose Reader and Data for data read access in Table Storage and File Storage.You should be familiar with indexer concepts and configuration.\uFF17 NoteIf storage is network-protected and in the same region as your search service, youmust use a system-assigned managed identity and either one of the followingnetwork options: connect as a trusted service, or connect using the resourceinstance rule.
