Whenyou\u0027re finished with this tutorial, remember to clean up the resources so that you aren\u0027tbilled for services you\u0027re not using.This example uses the sample DecryptBlobFile project from the Azure Search PowerSkills GitHub repository.\r\nIn this section, you will deploy the skill to an Azure Functionso that it can be used in a skillset. A built-in deployment script creates an AzureFunction resource named starting with psdbf-function-app- and loads the skill. You\u0027ll beprompted to provide a subscription and resource group.\r\nBe sure to choose the samesubscription that your Azure Key Vault instance lives in.Operationally, the DecryptBlobFile skill takes the URL and SAS token for each blob asinputs, and it outputs the downloaded, decrypted file using the file reference contractthat Azure AI Search expects. Recall that DecryptBlobFile needs the encryption key toperform the decryption. As part of setup, you\u0027ll also create an access policy that grantsDecryptBlobFile function access to the encryption key in Azure Key Vault.1. Click the Deploy to Azure button found on the DecryptBlobFile landing page,which will open the provided Resource Manager template within the Azure portal.2.\n"
