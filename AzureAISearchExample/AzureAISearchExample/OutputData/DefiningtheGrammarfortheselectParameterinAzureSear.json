A single star (*), indicating that all retrievable fields should be returned, or2. A comma-separated list of field paths, identifying which fields should be returned.When using the second form, you may only specify retrievable fields in the list.\r\nIf you list a complex field without specifying its subfields explicitly, all retrievablesubfields will be included in the query result set. For example, assume your index has anSyntaxselect_expression ::= \u0027*\u0027 | field_path(\u0027,\u0027 field_path)*field_path ::= identifier(\u0027/\u0027identifier)*OData syntax diagram for Azure AI Search\uFF17 NoteSee OData expression syntax reference for Azure AI Search for the completeEBNF.\r\nAddress field with Street, City, and Country subfields that are all retrievable.
