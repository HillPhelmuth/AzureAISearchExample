Lambda expressions over collections of thesetypes can contain simple expressions using any of these operators. This applies to bothany and all. For example, these filters are allowed:ratings/any(r: r ne 5)dates/any(d: d gt 2017-08-24T00:00:00Z)not margins/all(m: m eq 3.\r\n5)However, there are limitations on how such comparison expressions can be combinedinto more complex expressions inside a lambda expression:Rules for any:Simple inequality expressions can\u0027t be usefully combined with any otherexpressions.\r\nFor example, this expression is allowed:ratings/any(r: r ne 5)but this expression isn\u0027t:ratings/any(r: r ne 5 and r gt 2)Rules for filtering comparable collectionsand while this expression is allowed, it isn\u0027t useful because the conditionsoverlap:ratings/any(r: r ne 5 or r gt 7)Simple comparison expressions involving eq, lt, le, gt, or ge can becombined with and/or. For example:ratings/any(r: r gt 2 and r le 5)ratings/any(r: r le 5 or r gt 7)Comparison expressions combined with and (conjunctions) can be furthercombined using or. This form is known in Boolean logic as \u0022Disjunctive NormalForm\u0022 (DNF). For example:ratings/any(r: (r gt 2 and r le 5) or (r gt 7 and r lt 10))Rules for all:Simple equality expressions can\u0027t be usefully combined with any otherexpressions.\n"
