  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThe enriched field will contain a string that is a logical representation of the in-memoryenriched document in JSON. The field value is a valid JSON document, however. Quotesare escaped so you\u0027ll need to replace \\\u0022 with \u0022 in order to view the document asformatted JSON.\r\nThe enriched field is intended for debugging purposes only, to help you understand thelogical shape of the content that expressions are being evaluated against. You shouldn\u0027tdepend on this field for indexing purposes.Add an enriched field as part of your index definition for debugging purposes:JSONMissing content could be the result of documents getting dropped during indexing.Free and Basic tiers have low limits on document size. Any file exceeding the limit isdropped during indexing. You can check for dropped documents in the Azure portal. Inthe search service dashboard, double-click the Indexers tile. Review the ratio ofsuccessful documents indexed.\r\nIf it isn\u0027t 100%, you can select the ratio to get moredetail.If the problem is related to file size, you might see an error like this: \u0022The blob \u003Cfile-name\u003E\u0022 has the size of \u003Cfile-size\u003E bytes, which exceed the maximum size for documentextraction for your current service tier.\u0022 For more information on indexer limits, seeService limits.\r\nRequest Body Syntax{   \u0022fields\u0022: [     // other fields go here.     {       \u0022name\u0022: \u0022enriched\u0022,       \u0022type\u0022: \u0022Edm.String\u0022,       \u0022searchable\u0022: false,       \u0022sortable\u0022: false,       \u0022filterable\u0022: false,       \u0022facetable\u0022: false     }   ] } Tip 6: Expected content fails to appearA second reason for content failing to appear might be related input/output mappingerrors. For example, an output target name is \u0022People\u0022 but the index field name is lower-case \u0022people\u0022. The system could return 201 success messages for the entire pipeline soyou think indexing succeeded, when in fact a field is empty.Image analysis is computationally intensive for even simple cases, so when images areespecially large or complex, processing times can exceed the maximum time allowed.\n"
