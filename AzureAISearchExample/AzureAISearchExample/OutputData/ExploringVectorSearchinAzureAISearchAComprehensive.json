It alsoexplains integration with other Azure services and covers terminology and conceptsrelated to vector search development.We recommend this article for background, but if you\u0027d rather get started, follow thesesteps:You could also begin with the vector quickstart or the code samples on GitHub.\r\nVector search is in the Azure portal and the Azure SDKs for .NET, Python, andJavaScript.Vector search is a new capability for indexing, storing, and retrieving vector embeddingsfrom a search index. You can use it to power similarity search, multi-modal search,recommendations engines, or applications implementing the Retrieval AugmentedGeneration (RAG) architecture. The following diagram shows the indexing and query workflows for vector search.Generate vector embeddings before you start, or try out integrated vectorization(preview).\uFF02Add vector fields to an index.\uFF02Load vector data into an index using push or pull methodologies.\uFF02Query vector data using the Azure portal, REST APIs, or Azure SDK packages.\n\uFF02What\u0027s vector search in Azure AI Search?\uF80AOn the indexing side, Azure AI Search takes vector embeddings and uses a nearestneighbors algorithm to co-locate similar vectors together in the search index (vectorsabout popular movies are closer than vectors about popular dog breeds).\n"
