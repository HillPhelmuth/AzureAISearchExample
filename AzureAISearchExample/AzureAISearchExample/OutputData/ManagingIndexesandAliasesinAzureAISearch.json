In this situation, a new service must be created.Pre-existing vector embeddings in your source documents. Azure AI Searchdoesn\u0027t generate vectors in the generally available version of vector search. Werecommend Azure OpenAI embedding models but you can use any model forvectorization. For more information, see Generate embeddings.You should know the dimensions limit of the model used to create theembeddings and how similarity is computed. In Azure OpenAI, for text-embedding-ada-002, the length of the numerical vector is 1536. Similarity iscomputed using cosine.You should be familiar with creating an index.\n"
