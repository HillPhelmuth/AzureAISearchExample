If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phraseextractor, consider using the Text Split skill.\r\nIf you do use a text split skill, set the pagelength to 5000 for the best performance.\uFF09 ImportantNamed entity recognition skill (v2)(Microsoft.Skills.Text.NamedEntityRecognitionSkill) is now discontinued replacedby Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityRecognitionSkill. Follow the recommendations inDeprecated Azure AI Search skills to migrate to a supported skill.\r\n\uFF17 NoteAs you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding moredocuments, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need to attach a billable AzureAI services resource. Charges accrue when calling APIs in Azure AI services, and forimage extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure AI Search. Thereare no charges for text extraction from documents.
