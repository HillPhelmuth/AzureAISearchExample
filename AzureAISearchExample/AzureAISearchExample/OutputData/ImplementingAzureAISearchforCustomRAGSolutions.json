  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfAdding an information retrieval systemgives you control over grounding data used by an LLM when it formulates a response.For an enterprise solution, RAG architecture means that you can constrain generative AIto your enterprise content sourced from vectorized documents, images, audio, and video.The decision about which information retrieval system to use is critical because itdetermines the inputs to the LLM. The information retrieval system should provide:Indexing strategies that load and refresh at scale, for all of your content, at thefrequency you require.Query capabilities and relevance tuning.\r\nThe system should return relevant results,in the short-form formats necessary for meeting the token length requirements ofLLM inputs.Security, global reach, and reliability for both data and operations.Integration with LLMs.Azure AI Search is a proven solution for information retrieval in a RAG architecture. Itprovides indexing and query capabilities, with the infrastructure and security of theAzure cloud. Through code and other components, you can design a comprehensiveRAG solution that includes all of the elements for generative AI over your proprietarycontent.Microsoft has several built-in implementations for using Azure AI Search in a RAGsolution.\r\n\uFF17 NoteNew to copilot and RAG concepts? Watch Vector search and state of the artretrieval for Generative AI apps.Approaches for RAG with Azure AI SearchAzure AI Studio, use a vector index and retrieval augmentation.Azure OpenAI Studio, use a search index with or without vectors.Azure Machine Learning, use a search index as a vector store in a prompt flow.\r\nCurated approaches make it simple to get started, but for more control over thearchitecture, you need a custom solution. These templates create end-to-end solutionsin:Python.NETJavaScriptJavaThe remainder of this article explores how Azure AI Search fits into a custom RAGsolution. A high-level summary of the pattern looks like this:Start with a user question or request (prompt).Send it to Azure AI Search to find relevant information.Send the top ranked search results to the LLM.Use the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of the LLM togenerate a response to the initial prompt.\n"
