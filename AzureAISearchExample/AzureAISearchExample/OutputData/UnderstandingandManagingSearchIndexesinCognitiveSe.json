See Create a search index instead.In Cognitive Search, indexes contain search documents. Conceptually, a document is asingle unit of searchable data in your index.\r\nFor example, a retailer might have adocument for each product, a news organization might have a document for eacharticle, a travel site might have a document for each hotel and destination, and so forth.Mapping these concepts to more familiar database equivalents: a search index equatesto a table, and documents are roughly equivalent to rows in a table.The structure of a document is determined by the index schema, as illustrated below.The \u0022fields\u0022 collection is typically the largest part of an index, where each field is named,assigned a data type, and attributed with allowable behaviors that determine how it\u0027sused.\r\nJSONContent of a search index{   \u0022name\u0022: \u0022name_of_index, unique across the service\u0022,   \u0022fields\u0022: [     {       \u0022name\u0022: \u0022name_of_field\u0022,       \u0022type\u0022: \u0022Edm.String | Collection(Edm.String) | Edm.Int32 | Edm.Int64 | Edm.Double | Edm.Boolean | Edm.DateTimeOffset | Edm.\r\nGeographyPoint\u0022, Other elements are collapsed for brevity, but the following links can provide the detail:Suggesters support type-ahead queries like autocompleteScoring Profiles are used for relevance tuningAnalyzers are used to process strings into tokens according to linguistic rules orother characteristics supported by the analyzerCross-origin remote scripting (CORS) is used for apps that issues requests fromdifferent domainsEncryption key is used for double-encryption of sensitive content in the index. A search document is defined by the \u0022fields\u0022 collection in the body of Create Indexrequest. You need fields for document identification (keys), storing searchable text, andfields for supporting filters, facets, and sorts. You might also need fields for data that auser never sees. For example, you might want fields for profit margins or marketingpromotions that you can use to modify search rank.\n"
