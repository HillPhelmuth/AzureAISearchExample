Instead of relying solely on lexical analysis andmatching individual query terms, Vector Search utilizes machine learning models tocapture the contextual meaning of words and phrases. It represents documents andqueries as vectors in a high-dimensional space called an embedding. By understandingthe intent behind the query, Vector Search can deliver more relevant results that alignwith the user\u0027s requirements, even if the exact terms are not present in the document.Moreover, Vector Search can be applied to various types of content, including imagesand videos, not just text. To learn how to index vector fields and perform vector search, you can refer to thesample. This sample provides detailed guidance on indexing vector fields anddemonstrates how to perform vector search.Additionally, for more comprehensive information about Vector Search, including itsconcepts and usage, you can refer to the documentation. The documentation providesin-depth explanations and guidance on leveraging the power of Vector Search in AzureCognitive Search.The Azure.Search.Documents client library (v1) is a brand new offering for Pythondevelopers who want to use search technology in their applications. There is an older, fullyfeatured Microsoft.Azure.\n"
