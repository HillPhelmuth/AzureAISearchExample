Inthis case, we used the Title, subtitle and body layout.\r\nEdit Fields, and select the fields you would like to visualize.Since we provided a sample result when we defined the connector, the app isaware of the fields available in your index.\uFF17 NoteTry this if you get a formula syntax error \u0022The function \u0027ClearCollect\u0027 has someinvalid functions\u0022:First, make sure the connector reference is correct. Clear the connectorname and begin typing the name of your connector. Intellisense shouldsuggest the right connector and verb.If the error persists, delete and recreate the connector. If there aremultiple instances of a connector, the app might be using the wrongone.8. Press F5 to preview the app.When you\u0027re working in your own subscription, it\u0027s a good idea at the end of a projectto identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running cancost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group todelete the entire set of resources.\n"
