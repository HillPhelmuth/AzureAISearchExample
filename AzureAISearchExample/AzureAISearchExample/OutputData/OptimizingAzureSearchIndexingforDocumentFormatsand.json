Bydefault, all blobs in the container are processed. You have several options for moreselective processing:Place blobs in a virtual folder. An indexer data source definition includes a \u0022query\u0022parameter that can take a virtual folder. If you specify a virtual folder, only thoseblobs in the folder are indexed.Include or exclude blobs by file type. The supported document formats list canhelp you determine which blobs to exclude. For example, you might want toADLS Gen2 implements an access control model that supports both Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and POSIX-like access control lists (ACLs) at theblob level. Azure Cognitive Search does not support document-level permissions.All users have the same level of access to all searchable and retrievable content inthe index. If document-level permissions are an application requirement, considersecurity trimming as a potential solution.Supported document formatsDetermine which blobs to indexexclude image or audio files that don\u0027t provide searchable text. This capability iscontrolled through configuration settings in the indexer.Include or exclude arbitrary blobs.\n"
