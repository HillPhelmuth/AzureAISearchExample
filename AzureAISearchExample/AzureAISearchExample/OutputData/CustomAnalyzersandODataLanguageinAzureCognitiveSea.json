The language is presented\u0022bottom-up\u0022 starting with the most basic elements. The OData expressions that you canconstruct in a query request range from simple to highly complex, but they all sharecommon elements.\r\nShared elements include:Field paths, which refer to specific fields of your index.Constants, which are literal values of a certain data type.Once you understand these common concepts, you can continue with the top-levelsyntax for each expression:$filter expressions are evaluated during query parsing, constraining search tospecific fields or adding match criteria used during index scans. $orderby expressions are applied as a post-processing step over a result set tosort the documents that are returned.$select expressions determine which document fields are included in the result set.The syntax of these expressions is distinct from the simple or full query syntax used inthe search parameter, although there\u0027s some overlap in the syntax for referencing fields.\n"
