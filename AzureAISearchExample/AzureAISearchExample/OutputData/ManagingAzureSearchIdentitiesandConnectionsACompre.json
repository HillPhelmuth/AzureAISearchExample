One method for specifying an enrichment cache is in the Import data wizard. Currently,the wizard doesn\u0027t accept a managed identity connection string for enrichment cache.However, after the wizard completes, you can update the connection string in theindexer JSON definition to specify either a system or user-assigned managed identity,and then rerun the indexer.When a system-assigned managed identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity for yoursearch service that can be used to authenticate to other Azure services within the sametenant and subscription.\r\nYou can then use this identity in Azure role-based accesscontrol (Azure RBAC) assignments that allow access to data during indexing.A system-assigned managed identity is unique to your search service and bound to theservice for its lifetime.1. Sign in to Azure portal and find your search service.2. Under Settings, select Identity.3. On the System assigned tab, under Status, select On. 4.

It\u0027s useful if you need moregranularity in role assignments because you can create separate identities for differentapplications and scenarios.\nCreate a user-assigned managed identity(preview)\uFF09 ImportantThis feature is in public preview under supplemental terms of use.
