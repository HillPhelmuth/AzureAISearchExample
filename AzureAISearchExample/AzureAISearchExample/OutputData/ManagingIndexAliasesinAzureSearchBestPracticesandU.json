  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfHTTPOnce you\u0027ve created your alias, you\u0027re ready to start using it. Aliases can be used for alldocument operations including querying, indexing, suggestions, and autocomplete.In the query below, instead of sending the request to hotel-samples-index, you caninstead send the request to my-alias and it will be routed accordingly.\r\nHTTPIf you expect to make updates to a production index, specify an alias rather than theindex name in your client-side application. Scenarios that require an index rebuild areoutlined in Drop and rebuild an index.\r\nREST APIPOST /aliases?api-version=2021-04-30-preview{    \u0022name\u0022: \u0022my-alias\u0022,    \u0022indexes\u0022: [\u0022hotel-samples-index\u0022]}Send requests to an index aliasPOST /indexes/my-alias/docs/search?api-version=2021-04-30-preview{    \u0022search\u0022: \u0022pool spa \u002Bairport\u0022,    \u0022searchMode\u0022: any,    \u0022queryType\u0022: \u0022simple\u0022,    \u0022select\u0022: \u0022HotelId, HotelName, Category, Description\u0022,    \u0022count\u0022: true}\uFF17 NoteYou can only use an alias with document operations or to get and update an indexdefinition.\r\nAliases can\u0027t be used to delete an index, can\u0027t be used with the AnalyzeText API, and can\u0027t be used as the targetIndexName on an indexer.An update to an alias may take up to 10 seconds to propagate through the systemso you should wait at least 10 seconds before performing any operation in theNow, whenever you need to update your application to point to a new index, all youneed to do is update the mapping in your alias. PUT is required for updates as describedin Create or Update Alias (REST preview).HTTPAfter you make the update to the alias, requests will automatically start to be routed tothe new index.\n"
