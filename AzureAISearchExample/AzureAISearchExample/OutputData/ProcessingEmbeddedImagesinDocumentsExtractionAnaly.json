Separation of image from text content occurs duringthe document cracking phase, and once the images are separated, they remain separateunless you explicitly merge the processed output back into the source text.\r\nText Merge is used to put image processing output back into the document. AlthoughText Merge is not a hard requirement, it\u0027s frequently invoked so that image output (OCRtext, OCR layoutText, image tags, image captions) can be reintroduced into thedocument.\r\nDepending on the skill, the image output replaces an embedded binaryimage with an in-place text equivalent. Image Analysis output can be merged at imagelocation. OCR output always appears at the end of each page.The following workflow outlines the process of image extraction, analysis, merging, andhow to extend the pipeline to push image-processed output into other text-based skillssuch as Entity Recognition or Text Translation.1. After connecting to the data source, the indexer loads and cracks sourcedocuments, extracting images and text, and queuing each content type forprocessing. An enriched document consisting only of a root node (\u0022document\u0022) iscreated.\r\n\u0022bird\u0022,     \u0022outdoor\u0022,     \u0022water\u0022,     \u0022flock\u0022,     \u0022animal\u0022,     \u0022bunch\u0022,     \u0022group\u0022,     \u0022several\u0022,     \u0022drink\u0022,     \u0022gathered\u0022,     \u0022pond\u0022,     \u0022different\u0022,     \u0022family\u0022,     \u0022same\u0022,     \u0022map\u0022,     \u0022text\u0022,     \u0022animal\u0022,     \u0022bird\u0022,     \u0022bird of prey\u0022,     \u0022eagle\u0022     . . .

Image enrichments execute, using \u0022/document/normalized_images\u0022 as input.4. Image outputs are passed into enriched documents, with each output as aseparate node. Outputs vary by skill (text and layoutText for OCR, tags andcaptions for Image Analysis).5.\n"
