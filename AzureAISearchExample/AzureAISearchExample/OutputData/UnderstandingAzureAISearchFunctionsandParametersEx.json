When using the LuceneBoolean operators in the search parameter, they will takeprecedence over this parameter.All the above parameters are equivalent to the corresponding search requestparameters in the Search API.The search.ismatch function returns a value of type Edm.Boolean, which allows you tocompose it with other filter sub-expressions using the Boolean logical operators.See OData expression syntax reference for Azure AI Search for the completeEBNF.search.\r\nismatch\uFF17 NoteAzure AI Search does not support using search.ismatch or search.ismatchscoringinside lambda expressions. This means it is not possible to write filters overThe search.ismatchscoring function, like the search.ismatch function, returns true fordocuments that match the full-text search query passed as a parameter.\r\nThe differencebetween them is that the relevance score of documents matching thesearch.ismatchscoring query will contribute to the overall document score, while in thecase of search.ismatch, the document score won\u0027t be changed.
