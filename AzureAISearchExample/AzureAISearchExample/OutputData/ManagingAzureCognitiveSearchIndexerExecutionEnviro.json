  "Title": "\u0022Managing Azure Cognitive Search Indexer Execution Environments and Limits\u0022",
  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfYou can\u0027t control or configure which environment is used. AzureCognitive Search determines the environment based on job composition and the abilityof the service to move an indexer job onto a content processor (some security featuresblock the multi-tenant environment).Indexer execution environments include:A private execution environment that runs on search nodes, specific to your searchservice.A multi-tenant environment with content processors, managed and secured byMicrosoft at no extra cost. This environment is used to offload computationallyintensive processing, leaving service-specific resources available for routineoperations.\r\nWhenever possible, most indexer jobs are executed in the multi-tenantenvironment.Indexer limits vary for each environment:Indexer executionWorkloadMaximumdurationMaximumjobsExecution environmentWorkloadMaximumdurationMaximumjobsExecution environmentPrivateexecution24 hoursOne indexerjob persearch unit .Indexing doesn\u0027t run in the background.\r\nInstead, thesearch service will balance all indexing jobs againstongoing queries and object management actions(such as creating or updating indexes). When runningindexers, you should expect to see some query latencyif indexing volumes are large.Multi-tenant2 hours IndeterminateBecause the content processing cluster is multi-tenant,nodes are added to meet demand.\r\nIf you experience adelay in on-demand or scheduled execution, it\u0027sprobably because the system is either adding nodes orwaiting for one to become available. Search units can be flexible combinations of partitions and replicas, but indexer jobsaren\u0027t tied to one or the other. In other words, if you have 12 units, you can have 12indexer jobs running concurrently in private execution, no matter how the search unitsare deployed. If more than two hours are needed to process all of the data, enable change detectionand schedule the indexer to run at two hour intervals. See Indexing a large data set formore strategies. \u0022Indeterminate\u0022 means that the limit isn\u0027t quantified by the number of jobs. Someworkloads, such as skillset processing, can run in parallel which could result in many jobseven though only one indexer is involved. Although the environment doesn\u0027t imposeconstraints, indexer limits for your search service still apply.A Run Indexer operation will detect and process only what it necessary to synchronizethe search index with changes in the underlying data source. Incremental indexing startsby locating an internal high-water mark to find the last updated search document, whichbecomes the starting point for indexer execution over new and updated documents inthe data source.\n"
