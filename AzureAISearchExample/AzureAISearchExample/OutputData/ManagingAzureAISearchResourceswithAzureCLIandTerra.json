Learn moreThis article shows how to use Terraform to create an Azure AI Search service usingTerraform.Terraform enables the definition, preview, and deployment of cloud infrastructure.Using Terraform, you create configuration files using HCL syntax. The HCL syntaxallows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that makeup your cloud infrastructure. After you create your configuration files, you create anexecution plan that allows you to preview your infrastructure changes before they\u0027redeployed. Once you verify the changes, you apply the execution plan to deploy theinfrastructure.In this article, you learn how to:Install and configure Terraform1. Create a directory in which to test and run the sample Terraform code and make itthe current directory.2. Create a file named main.\n"
