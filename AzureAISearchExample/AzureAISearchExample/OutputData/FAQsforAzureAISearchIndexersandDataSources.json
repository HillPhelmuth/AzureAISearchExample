  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfFor example, if you have aninteger column where deleted rows are marked with the value 1, use \u00221\u0022. If you have aBIT column where deleted rows are marked with the Boolean true value, use the stringliteral \u0022True\u0022 or \u0022true\u0022, the case doesn\u0027t matter.\r\nIf you\u0027re setting up a soft delete policy from the Azure portal, don\u0027t add quotes aroundthe soft delete marker value. The field contents are already understood as a string andwill be translated automatically into a JSON string for you. In the examples above,simply type 1, True or true into the portal\u0027s field.Q: Can I index Always Encrypted columns?No.\r\nAlways Encrypted columns aren\u0027t currently supported by Azure AI Search indexers.Q: Can I use Azure SQL indexer with SQL databases running on IaaS VMs in Azure?Yes. However, you need to allow your search service to connect to your database. Formore information, see Configure a connection from an Azure AI Search indexer to SQLServer on an Azure VM.\r\nQ: Can I use Azure SQL indexer with SQL databases running on-premises?Not directly. We don\u0027t recommend or support a direct connection, as doing so wouldrequire you to open your databases to Internet traffic. Customers have succeeded withthis scenario using bridge technologies like Azure Data Factory.\r\nFor more information,see Push data to an Azure AI Search index using Azure Data Factory.Q: Can I use a secondary replica in a failover cluster as a data source?It depends. For full indexing of a table or view, you can use a secondary replica.For incremental indexing, Azure AI Search supports two change detection policies: SQLintegrated change tracking and High Water Mark. On read-only replicas, SQL Database doesn\u0027t support integrated change tracking.Therefore, you must use High Water Mark policy.Our standard recommendation is to use the rowversion data type for the high watermark column. However, using rowversion relies on the MIN_ACTIVE_ROWVERSION function,which isn\u0027t supported on read-only replicas.\n"
