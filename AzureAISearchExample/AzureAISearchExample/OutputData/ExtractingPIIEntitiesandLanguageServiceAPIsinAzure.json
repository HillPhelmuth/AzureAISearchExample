If your text is empty, a warning is returned.\r\nIf your text is largerthan 50,000 characters, only the first 50,000 characters will be analyzed and a warningwill be issued.If the skill returns a warning, the output maskedText may be empty, which can impactany downstream skills that expect the output. For this reason, be sure to investigate allwarnings related to missing output when writing your skillset definition.
