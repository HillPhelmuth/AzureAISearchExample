Grayed options in the field list indicate values thatcan\u0027t be modified or deleted.\r\nYou now have a search index that can be queried with Search explorer. Search explorersends REST calls that conform to the Search POST REST API. The tool supports simplequery syntax and full Lucene query syntax.1. On the Search explorer tab, enter text to search on.2. Use the Mini-map to jump quickly to nonvisible areas of the output.\r\nAdd or change fieldsQuery with Search explorer3. To specify syntax, switch to the JSON view.The following examples assume the JSON view and the 2023-11-01 REST API version.Parking, tags, renovation date, rating and location are filterable.JSONBoolean filters assume \u0022true\u0022 by default.\r\nJSONExample queries for hotels sample indexFilter examples{    \u0022search\u0022: \u0022beach OR spa\u0022,    \u0022select\u0022: \u0022HotelId, HotelName, Description, Rating\u0022,    \u0022count\u0022: true,    \u0022top\u0022: 10,    \u0022filter\u0022: \u0022Rating gt 4\u0022}Geospatial search is filter-based.

JSONBy default, misspelled query terms like seatle for Seattle fail to return matches in atypical search. The queryType=full parameter invokes the full Lucene query parser,which supports the tilde ~ operand. When these parameters are present, the queryperforms a fuzzy search for the specified keyword.\n"
