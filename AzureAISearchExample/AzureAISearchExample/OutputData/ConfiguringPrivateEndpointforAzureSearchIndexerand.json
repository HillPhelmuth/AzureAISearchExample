  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThere are no properties in any of these definitions that vary whenusing a shared private endpoint.2. Create an indexer that points to the data source, index, and skillset that youcreated in the preceding step. In addition, force the indexer to run in the privateexecution environment by setting the indexer executionEnvironment configurationproperty to private.\r\nJSONFollowing is an example of the request in Postman.\uFF17 NoteYou can perform this step before the private endpoint connection is approved.However, until the private endpoint connection shows as approved, any existingindexer that tries to communicate with a secure resource (such as the storageaccount) will end up in a transient failure state and new indexers will fail to becreated.\r\n{    \u0022name\u0022: \u0022indexer\u0022,    \u0022dataSourceName\u0022: \u0022blob-datasource\u0022,    \u0022targetIndexName\u0022: \u0022index\u0022,    \u0022parameters\u0022: {        \u0022configuration\u0022: {            \u0022executionEnvironment\u0022: \u0022private\u0022        }    },    \u0022fieldMappings\u0022: []}After the indexer is created successfully, it should connect to the Azure resource overthe private endpoint connection.\r\nYou can monitor the status of the indexer by using theIndexer Status API.1. If you haven\u0027t done so already, verify that your Azure PaaS resource refusesconnections from the public internet. If connections are accepted, review the DNSsettings in the Networking page of your Azure PaaS resource.2.\r\nChoose a tool that can invoke an outbound request scenario, such as an indexerconnection to a private endpoint. An easy choice is using the Import data wizard,but you can also try the Postman app and REST APIs for more precision. Assumingthat your search service isn\u0027t also configured for a private connection, the RESTclient connection to Search can be over the public internet.3. Set the connection string to the private Azure PaaS resource. The format of theconnection string doesn\u0027t change for shared private link. The search serviceinvokes the shared private link internally.\uFF17 NoteIf you already have existing indexers, you can update them via the PUT API bysetting the executionEnvironment to private or using the JSON editor in the portal.\n"
