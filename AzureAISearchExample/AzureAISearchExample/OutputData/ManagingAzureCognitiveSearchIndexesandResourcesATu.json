If you want to see the full listof fields, remove the \u0022select\u0022 parameter.PythonThe following screenshot shows the cell output for sample script.\r\n\uFF17 NoteIf you can\u0027t use default search index, you can provide an external custom definitionin JSON, passing its URI as a string in the \u0022indexJson\u0022 property. Generate thedefault index first so that you know which fields to specify, and then follow withcustomized properties if you need specific analyzers, for example.8 - Query the indeximport requestsurl = \u0022https://{}.\r\nsearch.windows.net/indexes/{}/docs/search?api-version=2020-06-30\u0022.format(search_service, search_index)requests.post(url, json={\u0022search\u0022: \u0022door\u0022, \u0022count\u0022: \u0022true\u0022, \u0022select\u0022: \u0022Description, Translations\u0022}, headers={\u0022api-key\u0022: search_key}).json()When you\u0027re working in your own subscription, at the end of a project, it\u0027s a good ideato remove the resources that you no longer need.\r\nResources left running can cost youmoney. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete theentire set of resources.You can find and manage resources in the portal, using the All resources or Resourcegroups link in the left-navigation pane. In this tutorial, you learned about the AzureSearchWriter transformer in SynapseML,which is a new way of creating and loading search indexes in Azure Cognitive Search.The transformer takes structured JSON as an input. The FormOntologyLearner canprovide the necessary structure for output produced by the Document Intelligencetransformers in SynapseML.As a next step, review the other SynapseML tutorials that produce transformed contentyou might want to explore through Azure Cognitive Search:Clean up resourcesNext stepsTutorial: Text Analytics with Azure AI servicesTutorial: Index Azure SQL data using the.\n"
