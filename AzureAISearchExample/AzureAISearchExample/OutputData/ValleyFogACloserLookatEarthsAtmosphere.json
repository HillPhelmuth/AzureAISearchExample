On clear winter nights, the \\n\\nground and overlying air cool off rapidly, especially at high elevations. Cold air is denser than warm air, and it sinks down into the \\n\\nvalleys. The moist air in the valleys gets chilled to its dew point, and fog forms. If undisturbed by winds, such fog may persist for \\n\\ndays. The Terra satellite captured this image of foggy valleys northeast of Vancouver in February 2010.\n"
