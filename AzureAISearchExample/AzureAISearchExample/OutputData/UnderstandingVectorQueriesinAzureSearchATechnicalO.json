In the exampleabove, a k value of three was used.\r\nVector queries always return k results,assuming at least k documents exist, even if there are documents with poorsimilarity, because the algorithm is only identifying the k nearest neighbors to thequery vector. As a result, note that both count and facet aggregations (facetcounts) operate on this k recall set.The @search.score is determined by the vector search algorithm (HNSW algorithmand a cosine similarity metric in this example).\r\nFields include text and vector values.
