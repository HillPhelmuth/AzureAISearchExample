  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfIf instead you\u0027re usingAzure AD logins and roles, make sure the search service\u0027s managed identity hasStorage Blob Data Reader permissions.By default, both search and storage accept requests from public IP addresses. Ifnetwork security isn\u0027t an immediate concern, you can index blob data using justthe connection string and read permissions. When you\u0027re ready to add networkprotections, see Indexer access to content protected by Azure network securityfeatures for guidance about data access.Use a REST client, such as Postman app, if you want to formulate REST callssimilar to the ones shown in this article.\r\nPrerequisitesThe blob indexer can extract text from the following document formats:CSV (see Indexing CSV blobs)EMLEPUBGZHTMLJSON (see Indexing JSON blobs)KML (XML for geographic representations)Microsoft Office formats:\r\nDOCX/DOC/DOCM, XLSX/XLS/XLSM, PPTX/PPT/PPTM,MSG (Outlook emails), XML (both 2003 and 2006 WORD XML)Open Document formats: ODT, ODS, ODPPDFPlain text files (see also Indexing plain text)RTFXMLZIPBefore you set up indexing, review your source data to determine whether any changesshould be made up front.\r\nAn indexer can index content from one container at a time. Bydefault, all blobs in the container are processed. You have several options for moreselective processing:Place blobs in a virtual folder. An indexer data source definition includes a \u0022query\u0022parameter that can take a virtual folder. If you specify a virtual folder, only thoseblobs in the folder are indexed.Include or exclude blobs by file type. The supported document formats list canhelp you determine which blobs to exclude. For example, you might want toexclude image or audio files that don\u0027t provide searchable text.\n"
