  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfBy default, the portal uses APIkeys to authenticate the request automatically. However, if you disable API keys andset up role assignments, the portal uses role assignments instead.In Cognitive Search, most tasks can be performed in Azure portal, including objectcreation, indexing through the Import data wizard, and queries through Searchexplorer.Portal\uFF17 NoteIt\u0027s considered a poor security practice to pass sensitive data such as an api-key inthe request URI. For this reason, Azure Cognitive Search only accepts a query key asan api-key in the query string. As a general rule, we recommend passing your api-key as a request header.\r\nPermissions for viewing and managing API keys are conveyed through role assignments.Members of the following roles can view and regenerate keys:OwnerContributorSearch Service ContributorAdministrator and co-administrator (classic)The following roles don\u0027t have access to API keys:ReaderSearch Index Data ContributorSearch Index Data ReaderYou can view and manage API keys in the Azure portal, or through PowerShell, AzureCLI, or REST API.\r\n1.
