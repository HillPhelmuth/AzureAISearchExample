The character filters andtoken filters are the building blocks for a custom normalizer and responsible for theprocessing of the text. These filters are applied from left to right.The token_filter_name_1 is the name of token filter, and char_filter_name_1 andchar_filter_name_2 are the names of char filters (see supported token filters andsupported char filterstables below for valid values).JSONCustom normalizers can be added during index creation or later by updating an existingone.
