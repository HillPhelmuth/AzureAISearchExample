  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfAzure OpenAI embedding models use cosine similarity, so if you\u0027re using Azure OpenAIembedding models, cosine is the recommended metric. Other supported rankingmetrics include euclidean and dotProduct.Multiple sets are created if the query targets multiple vector fields, or if the query is ahybrid of vector and full text search, with or without semantic ranking. Within vectorsearch, a vector query can only target one internal vector index. So for multiple vectorfields and multiple vector queries, the search engine generates multiple queries thattarget the respective vector indexes of each field. Output is a set of ranked results foreach query, which are fused using RRF.\r\nFor more information, see Vector queryexecution and scoring.As a next step, we recommend reviewing the demo code for Python, C# orJavaScript.RankingNext stepsCreate a hybrid query in Azure AI SearchArticle\u202211/16/2023Hybrid search consists of keyword queries and vector queries in a single search request.The response includes the top results ordered by search score.\r\nBoth vector queries andfree text queries are assigned an initial search score from their respective scoring orsimilarity algorithms. Those scores are merged using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) toreturn a single ranked result set.Azure AI Search, in any region and on any tier. Most existing services supportvector search.\r\nFor services created prior to January 2019, there\u0027s a small subset thatdoesn\u0027t support vector search. If an index containing vector fields fails to becreated or updated, this is an indicator. In this situation, a new service must becreated.A search index containing vector and non-vector fields. See Create an index andAdd vector fields to a search index. Use Search Post REST API version 2023-11-01, Search Explorer in the Azure portal,or packages in the Azure SDKs that have been updated to use this feature.(Optional) If you want to also use semantic ranking and vector search together,your search service must be Basic tier or higher, with semantic ranking enabled.\n"
