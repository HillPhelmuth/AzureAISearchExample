However, it\u0027s possible to turn off APIkey authentication and use Azure role-based access control exclusively. If you turn offAPI keys, be sure to set up data access role assignments so that all features in the portalremain operational.Review monitoring capabilities available in the portalAutomate with PowerShell or Azure CLIReview security features to protect content and operationsEnable resource logging to monitor query and indexing workloads\uEA80 TipBy default, any owner or administrator can create or delete services.
