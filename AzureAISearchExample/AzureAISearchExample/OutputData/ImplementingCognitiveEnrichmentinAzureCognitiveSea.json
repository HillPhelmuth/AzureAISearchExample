  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfIfthere is a problem with the request, such as an invalid parameter, the method will throwan exception.Now add a line in Main to call the CreateOrUpdateDataSource function that you\u0027ve justadded.C#Build and run the solution. Since this is your first request, check the Azure portal toconfirm the data source was created in Azure Cognitive Search. On the search serviceoverview page, verify the Data Sources list has a new item. You might need to wait a fewminutes for the portal page to refresh.In this section, you define a set of enrichment steps that you want to apply to your data.\r\nEach enrichment step is called a skill and the set of enrichment steps, a skillset. Thistutorial uses built-in cognitive skills for the skillset:Optical Character Recognition to recognize printed and handwritten text in imagefiles.Text Merger to consolidate text from a collection of fields into a single \u0022mergedcontent\u0022 field.Language Detection to identify the content\u0027s language.Entity Recognition for extracting the names of organizations from content in theblob container.// Create or Update the data sourceConsole.WriteLine(\u0022Creating or updating the data source...\r\n\u0022);SearchIndexerDataSourceConnection dataSource = CreateOrUpdateDataSource(indexerClient, configuration);Step 2: Create a skillsetText Split to break large content into smaller chunks before calling the key phraseextraction skill and the entity recognition skill. Key phrase extraction and entityrecognition accept inputs of 50,000 characters or less. A few of the sample filesneed splitting up to fit within this limit.Key Phrase Extraction to pull out the top key phrases.During initial processing, Azure Cognitive Search cracks each document to extractcontent from different file formats. Text originating in the source file is placed into agenerated content field, one for each document. As such, set the input as\u0022/document/content\u0022 to use this text. Image content is placed into a generatednormalized_images field, specified in a skillset as /document/normalized_images/*.Outputs can be mapped to an index, used as input to a downstream skill, or both as isthe case with language code. In the index, a language code is useful for filtering. As aninput, language code is used by text analysis skills to inform the linguistic rules aroundword breaking.For more information about skillset fundamentals, see How to define a skillset.The OcrSkill extracts text from images.\n"
