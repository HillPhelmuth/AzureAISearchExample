Once an AML model is trained and deployed, an AML skillintegrates it into AI enrichment.\r\nLike built-in skills, an AML skill has inputs and outputs. The inputs are sent to yourdeployed AML online endpoint as a JSON object, which outputs a JSON payload as aresponse along with a success status code. The response is expected to have theoutputs specified by your AML skill. Any other response is considered an error and noenrichments are performed.\r\nAn AML workspaceAn Online endpoints (real-time) in this workspace.Microsoft.Skills.Custom.AmlSkill\uFF09 ImportantThis skill is in public preview under supplemental terms of use.
