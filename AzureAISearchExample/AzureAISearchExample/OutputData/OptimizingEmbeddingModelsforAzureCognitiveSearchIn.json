  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfChoose the right embedding model: Select an appropriate model for your specificuse case, such as word embeddings for text-based searches or image embeddingsfor visual searches. Consider using pretrained models like text-embedding-ada-002 from OpenAI or Image Retrieval REST API from Azure AI Computer Vision.Normalize Vector lengths: Ensure that the vector lengths are normalized beforestoring them in the search index to improve the accuracy and performance ofsimilarity search. Most pretrained models already are normalized but not all.Fine-tune the model: If needed, fine-tune the selected model on your domain-specific data to improve its performance and relevance to your search application.\r\nTest and iterate: Continuously test and refine your embedding model integrationto achieve the desired search performance and user satisfaction.Understanding embeddings in Azure OpenAI ServiceLearn how to generate embeddingsTutorial: Explore Azure OpenAI Service embeddings and document searchNext stepsLoad data into a search index in AzureCognitive SearchArticle\u202210/21/2022This article explains how to import, refresh, and manage content in a predefined searchindex. In Azure Cognitive Search, a search index is created first, with data importfollowing as a second step.\r\nThe exception is Import Data wizard, which creates and loadsan index in one workflow.A search service imports and indexes text in JSON, used in full text search or knowledgemining scenarios. Text content is obtainable from alphanumeric fields in the externaldata source, metadata that\u0027s useful in search scenarios, or enriched content created by askillset (skills can extract or infer textual descriptions from images and unstructuredcontent).Once data is indexed, the physical data structures of the index are locked in. Forguidance on what can and can\u0027t be changed, see Drop and rebuild an index.Indexing isn\u0027t a background process. A search service will balance indexing and queryworkloads, but if query latency is too high, you can either add capacity or identifyperiods of low query activity for loading an index.A search service accepts JSON documents that conform to the index schema.You can prepare these documents yourself, but if content resides in a supported datasource, running an indexer or the Import data wizard can automate document retrieval,JSON serialization, and indexing.\n"
