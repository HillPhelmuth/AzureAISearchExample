By default, the indexerparses the content as a single chunk of text.\r\nHowever, if all blobs and files contain plaintext in the same encoding, you can significantly improve indexing performance by usingthe text parsing mode.Recommendations for use text parsing include:File type is .txtFiles are of any type, but the content itself is text (for example, program sourcecode, HTML, XML, and so forth). For files in a mark up language, any syntaxcharacters will come through as static text.\r\nRecall that all indexers serialize to JSON. By default, the contents of the entire text filewill be indexed within one large field as \u0022content\u0022: \u0022\u003Cfile-contents\u003E\u0022. Any new lineand return instructions are embedded in the content field and expressed as \\r\\n\\.\r\nIf you want a more granular outcome, and if the file type is compatible, consider thefollowing solutions:delimitedText parsing mode, if the source is CSVjsonArray or jsonLines, if the source is JSONA third option for breaking content into multiple parts requires advanced features in theform of AI enrichment. It adds analysis that identifies and assigns chunks of the file todifferent search fields. You might find a full or partial solution through built-in skills, buta more likely solution would be learning model that understands your content,articulated in custom learning model, wrapped in a custom skill.To index plain text blobs, create or update an indexer definition with the parsingModeconfiguration property to text on a Create Indexer request:HTTPSet up plain text indexingBy default, the UTF-8 encoding is assumed. To specify a different encoding, use theencoding configuration property:HTTPParsing modes are specified in the indexer definition.HTTPIndexers in Azure Cognitive SearchHow to configure a blob indexerBlob indexing overviewPUT https://[service name].\n"
