  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfYou can create an alias that maps toa search index and substitute the alias name in places where you would otherwisereference an index name. An alias adds flexibility if you need to change which index yourapplication is pointing to. Instead of updating the references in your application, youcan just update the mapping for your alias.The main goal of index aliases is to make it easier to manage your production indexes.For example, if you need to make a change to your index definition, such as editing afield or adding a new analyzer, you\u0027ll have to create a new search index because allsearch indexes are immutable.\r\nThis means you either need to drop and rebuild yourindex or create a new index and then migrate your application over to that index.Instead of dropping and rebuilding your index, you can use index aliases. A typicalworkflow would be to:1. Create your search index2. Create an alias that maps to your search index3. Have your application send querying/indexing requests to the alias rather than theindex name4.\r\nWhen you need to make a change to your index that requires a rebuild, create anew search index5. When your new index is ready to go, update the alias to map to the new index andrequests will automatically be routed to the new indexYou can create an alias using the preview REST API, the preview SDKs, or through theAzure portal.\r\nAn alias consists of the name of the alias and the name of the searchindex that the alias is mapped to. Only one index name can be specified in the indexesarray.\uFF09 ImportantIndex aliases are currently in public preview and available under supplementalterms of use.Create an index aliasYou can use the Create or Update Alias (REST preview) to create an index alias. HTTPOnce you\u0027ve created your alias, you\u0027re ready to start using it. Aliases can be used for alldocument operations including querying, indexing, suggestions, and autocomplete.In the query below, instead of sending the request to hotel-samples-index, you caninstead send the request to my-alias and it will be routed accordingly.\nHTTPIf you expect to make updates to a production index, specify an alias rather than theindex name in your client-side application. Scenarios that require an index rebuild areoutlined in Drop and rebuild an index.\n"
