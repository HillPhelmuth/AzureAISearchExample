Query latencyS3 PerformanceQueries per secondIn this case, we see that adding a second partition significantly increases the maximumQPS but adding a third partition provides diminishing marginal returns. The smallerimprovement is likely because all of the data is already being pulled into the S3\u0027s activememory with just two partitions.Query latency varies based on the load of the service and services under higher stresswill have a higher average query latency.
