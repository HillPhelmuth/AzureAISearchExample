Instead, customers typically point their applicationdeployment solution at a different search service (if using the same index name), orrevise the name to create a copy on the current search service, and then build it.Index isolationContinuously availableEndpoint connection and securityAll indexing and query requests target an index. Endpoints are usually one of thefollowing:EndpointConnection and access control\u003Cyour-service\u003E.search.windows.\r\nnet/indexesTargets the indexes collection. Used when creating,listing, or deleting an index.

Fordata refresh, admin rights are required.You can get hands-on experience creating an index using almost any sample orwalkthrough for Cognitive Search. For starters, you could choose any of the quickstartsfrom the table of contents.\r\nBut you\u0027ll also want to become familiar with methodologies for loading an index withdata. Index definition and data import strategies are defined in tandem. The followingarticles provide more information about creating and loading an index.

Because AzureAI Search imposes limits on vector index size, it\u0027s important that you know how toretrieve metrics about the vector index size, and how to estimate the vector index sizerequirements for your use case.\n"
