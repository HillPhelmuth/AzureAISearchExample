  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThe following example is a schedule that starts on January 1 at midnight and runs everytwo hours.JSONSchedules are specified in an indexer definition. To set up a schedule, you can use Azureportal, REST APIs, or an Azure SDK.1. Sign in to Azure portal and open the search service page.2. On the Overview page, select the Indexers tab.\r\n3. Select an indexer.4. Select Settings.5. Scroll down to Schedule, and then choose Hourly, Daily, or Custom to set aspecific date, time, or custom interval.\r\n{     \u0022dataSourceName\u0022 : \u0022hotels-ds\u0022,     \u0022targetIndexName\u0022 : \u0022hotels-idx\u0022,     \u0022schedule\u0022 : { \u0022interval\u0022 : \u0022PT2H\u0022, \u0022startTime\u0022 : \u00222022-01-01T00:00:00Z\u0022 } } Configure a scheduleAzure portalFor text-based indexing, the scheduler can kick off as many indexer jobs as the searchservice supports, which is determined by the number of search units.\r\nFor example, if theservice has three replicas and four partitions, you can generally have 12 indexer jobs inactive execution, whether initiated on demand or on a schedule.\r\nSkills-based indexers run in a different execution environment. For this reason, thenumber of service units has no bearing on the number of skills-based indexer jobs youcan run. Multiple skills-based indexers can run in parallel, but doing so depends onnode availability within the execution environment.Although multiple indexers can run simultaneously, a given indexer is single instance.You can\u0027t run two copies of the same indexer concurrently. If an indexer happens to stillbe running when its next scheduled execution is set to start, the pending execution ispostponed until the next scheduled occurrence, allowing the current job to finish. Let\u2019s consider an example to make this more concrete. Suppose we configure an indexerschedule with an interval of hourly and a start time of June 1, 2022 at 8:00:00 AM UTC.Here\u0027s what could happen when an indexer run takes longer than an hour:The first indexer execution starts at or around June 1, 2022 at 8:00 AM UTC.\n"
