Semi-structured data containstags or markings which separate content within the data.\r\nIt splits the difference betweenunstructured data, which must be fully indexed, and formally structured data thatadheres to a data model, such as a relational database schema, that can be indexed on aper-field basis.This tutorial uses Postman and the Search REST APIs to perform the following tasks:If you don\u0027t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.\r\nAzure StoragePostman appCreate or find an existing search serviceClinical-trials-json.zip contains the data used in this tutorial.

A free search service limits you to threeindexes, three indexers, and three data sources. This tutorial creates one of each.Before starting, make sure you have room on your service to accept the newresources.Download filesThis tutorial uses Azure AI Search for indexing and queries, and Azure Blob Storage toprovide the data.If possible, create both in the same region and resource group for proximity andmanageability. In practice, your Azure Storage account can be in any region.1. Sign in to the Azure portal and click \u002B Create Resource.2.
