  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThe query that flattens thecollective data into a row set embeds all of the room information in JSONdocuments in each hotel record. The embedded room information is a generatedby a query that uses a FOR JSON AUTO clause.You can learn more about this technique in define a query that returns embeddedJSON. This is just one example; you can find other approaches that produce thesame result.\r\nFilesAn indexer generally creates one search document for each file, where the searchdocument consists of fields for content and metadata. Depending on the file type,the indexer can sometimes parse one file into multiple search documents. Forexample, in a CSV file, each row can become a standalone search document.Remember that you only need to pull in searchable and filterable data:Searchable data is text.Filterable data is alphanumeric.Cognitive Search can\u0027t search over binary data in any format, although it can extract andinfer text descriptions of image files (see AI enrichment) to create searchable content.\r\nLikewise, large text can be broken down and analyzed by natural language models tofind structure or relevant information, generating new content that you can add to asearch document.Given that indexers don\u0027t fix data problems, other forms of data cleansing ormanipulation might be needed. For more information, you should refer to the productdocumentation of your Azure database product.\r\nIndexers require a data source that specifies the type, container, and connection.1. Make sure you\u0027re using a supported data source type.Prepare a data source2. Create a data source definition. The following list is a few of the more frequentlyused data sources:Azure Blob StorageAzure Cosmos DBAzure SQL Database3. If the data source is a database, such as Azure SQL or Cosmos DB, enable changetracking. Azure Storage has built-in change tracking through the LastModifiedproperty on every blob, file, and table. The above links for the various data sourcesexplain which change tracking methods are supported by indexers.Indexers also require a search index. Recall that indexers pass data off to the searchengine for indexing. Just as indexers have properties that determine execution behavior,an index schema has properties that profoundly affect how strings are indexed (onlystrings are analyzed and tokenized).1. Start with Create a search index.2.\n"
