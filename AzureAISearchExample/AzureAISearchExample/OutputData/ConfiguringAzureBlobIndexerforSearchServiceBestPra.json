In this way,information for all blobs is indexed regardless of document type, stored in an index inyour search service.\r\nUsing your new index, you can then proceed to sort, filter, and facetacross all Blob storage content.The output of an indexer is a search index, used for interactive exploration using freetext and filtered queries in a client app. For initial exploration and verification of content,we recommend starting with Search Explorer in the portal to examine documentstructure.\r\nIn Search explorer, you can use:Simple query syntaxFull query syntaxFilter expression syntaxIndexing blob metadata\uFF17 NoteBlob Index tags are natively indexed by the Blob storage service and exposed forquerying. If your blobs\u0027 key/value attributes require indexing and filteringcapabilities, Blob Index tags should be leveraged instead of metadata.\r\nTo learn more about Blob Index, see Manage and find data on Azure Blob Storagewith Blob Index.Search blob content in a search indexA more permanent solution is to gather query inputs and present the response assearch results in a client application.
