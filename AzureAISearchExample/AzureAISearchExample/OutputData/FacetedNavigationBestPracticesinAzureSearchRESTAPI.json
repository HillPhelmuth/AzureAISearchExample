Facets work best on fields with low cardinality.\r\nDue to the resolution of geo-coordinates, it\u0027s rare that any two sets of coordinates will be equal in a given dataset. Assuch, facets aren\u0027t supported for geo-coordinates. You would need a city or region fieldto facet by location.Facets are specified on the query, and the faceted navigation structure is returned at thetop of the response.\r\nThe structure of a request and response is fairly simple. In fact, thereal work behind faceted navigation lies in the presentation layer, covered in a latersection.The following REST example is an unqualified query (\u0022search\u0022: \u0022*\u0022) that is scoped tothe entire index (see the built-in hotels sample).\r\nFacets are usually a list of fields, but thisquery shows just one for a more readable response below.HTTP\uEA80 TipAs a best practice for performance and storage optimization, turn faceting off forfields that should never be used as a facet. In particular, string fields for uniquevalues, such as an ID or product name, should be set to \u0022facetable\u0022: false toprevent their accidental (and ineffective) use in faceted navigation. This is especiallytrue for the REST API that enables filters and facets by default.Facet request and responsePOST https://{{service_name}}.search.windows. net/indexes/hotels/docs/search?api-version={{api_version}}{    \u0022search\u0022: \u0022*\u0022,    \u0022queryType\u0022: \u0022simple\u0022,    \u0022select\u0022: \u0022\u0022,    \u0022searchFields\u0022: \u0022\u0022,    \u0022filter\u0022: \u0022\u0022,    \u0022facets\u0022: [ \u0022Category\u0022],     \u0022orderby\u0022: \u0022\u0022,    \u0022count\u0022: true}It\u0027s useful to initialize a search page with an open query to completely fill in the facetednavigation structure.\n"
