You can expect amore cohesive experience when you create an app based on your own indexes.When you\u0027re working in your own subscription, it\u0027s a good idea at the end of a projectto identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running cancost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group todelete the entire set of resources.You can find and manage resources in the portal, using the All resources or Resourcegroups link in the left-navigation pane.\r\nIf you\u0027re using a free service, remember that it\u0027s limited to three indexes, indexers, anddata sources. You can delete individual items in the portal to stay under the limit.\r\nCreate, download and executeClean up resourcesNext stepsThe demo app is useful for prototyping because you can simulate an end-userexperience without having to write JavaScript or front-end code, but as you get closer toproof-of-concept in your own project, review one of the end-to-end code samples thatis closer facsimile of a real-word app:\r\nAdd search to web appsQuickstart: Create a skillset in the AzureportalArticle\u202211/30/2023In this quickstart, you learn how a skillset in Azure AI Search adds Optical CharacterRecognition (OCR), image analysis, language detection, text translation, and entityrecognition to generate text-searchable content in a search index. You can run the Import data wizard in the Azure portal to apply skills that create andtransform textual content during indexing. Input is your raw data, usually blobs in AzureStorage. Output is a searchable index containing AI-generated image text, captions, andentities. Generated content is queryable in the portal using Search explorer.To prepare, you create a few resources and upload sample files before running thewizard.Before you begin, have the following prerequisites in place:An Azure account with an active subscription.\n"
