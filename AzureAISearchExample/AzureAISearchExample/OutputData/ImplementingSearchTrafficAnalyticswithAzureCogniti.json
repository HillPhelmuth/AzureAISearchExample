It requires that you add instrumentation to your client code, asdescribed in this article. Finally, you will need a reporting mechanism to analyze thedata. We recommend Power BI, but you can use the Application Dashboard or any toolthat connects to Application Insights.To have useful metrics for search traffic analytics, it\u0027s necessary to log some signals fromthe users of your search application. These signals signify content that users areinterested in and that they consider relevant. For search traffic analytics, these include:User-generated search events: Only search queries initiated by a user areinteresting. Other search requests, such as those used to populate facets orretrieve internal information, are not important. Be sure to only instrument user-initiated events to avoid skew or bias in your results.\n"
