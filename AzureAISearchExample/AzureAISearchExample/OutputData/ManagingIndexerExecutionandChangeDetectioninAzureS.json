  "Title": "\u0022Managing Indexer Execution and Change Detection in Azure Search\u0022",
  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdf\u0022Indeterminate\u0022 means that the limit isn\u0027t quantified by the number of jobs. Someworkloads, such as skillset processing, can run in parallel which could result in many jobseven though only one indexer is involved. Although the environment doesn\u0027t imposeconstraints, indexer limits for your search service still apply.A Run Indexer operation will detect and process only what it necessary to synchronizethe search index with changes in the underlying data source. Incremental indexing startsby locating an internal high-water mark to find the last updated search document, whichbecomes the starting point for indexer execution over new and updated documents inthe data source.\r\nChange detection is essential for determining what\u0027s new or updated in the data source.Indexers use the change detection capabilities of the underlying data source todetermine what\u0027s new or updated in the data source.Azure Storage has built-in change detection through its LastModified property.\r\n123123Run without resetOther data sources, such as Azure SQL or Azure Cosmos DB, have to be configuredfor change detection before the indexer can read new and updated rows.If the underlying content is unchanged, a run operation has no effect. In this case,indexer execution history will indicate 0\\0 documents processed.You\u0027ll need to reset the indexer, as explained in the next section, to reprocess in full.\r\nAfter the initial run, an indexer keeps track of which search documents have beenindexed through an internal high-water mark. The marker is never exposed, butinternally the indexer knows where it last stopped.If you need to rebuild all or part of an index, you can clear the indexer\u0027s high-water markthrough a reset. Reset APIs are available at decreasing levels in the object hierarchy:Reset Indexers clears the high-water mark and performs a full reindex of alldocumentsReset Documents (preview) reindexes a specific document or list of documentsReset Skills (preview) invokes skill processing for a specific skillAfter reset, follow with a Run command to reprocess new and existing documents.\n"
