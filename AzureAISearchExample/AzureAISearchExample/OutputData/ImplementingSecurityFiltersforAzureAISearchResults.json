In Azure AI Search, a security filter is a regular OData filter that includes or excludes asearch result based on a matching value, except that in a security filter, the criteria is astring consisting of a security principal. There\u0027s no authentication or authorizationthrough the security principal. The principal is just a string, used in a filter expression, toinclude or exclude a document from the search results.There are several ways to achieve security filtering. One way is through a complicateddisjunction of equality expressions: for example, Id eq \u0027id1\u0027 or Id eq \u0027id2\u0027, and soforth.\n"
