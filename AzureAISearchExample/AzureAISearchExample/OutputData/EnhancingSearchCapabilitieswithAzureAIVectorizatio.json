Most existing services supportvector search. For services created prior to January 2019, a small subset won\u0027tsupport vector search. If an index containing vector fields fails to be created orupdated, this is an indicator. In this situation, a new service must be created.A search index containing vector fields. See Add vector fields to a search index.\r\nUse REST API version 2023-11-01 if you want the stable version. Otherwise, you cancontinue to use 2023-10-01-Preview, 2023-07-01-Preview, the Azure SDK libraries,or Search Explorer in the Azure portal.The stable version (2023-11-01) doesn\u0027t provide built-in vectorization of the query inputstring.\r\nEncoding (text-to-vector) of the query string requires that you pass the querystring to an external embedding model for vectorization. You would then pass theresponse to the search engine for similarity search over vector fields.The preview version (2023-10-01-Preview) adds integrated vectorization. Create andassign a vectorizer to get built-in embedding of query strings. Update your query toprovide a text string to the vectorizer.All results are returned in plain text, including vectors in fields marked as retrievable.Because numeric vectors aren\u0027t useful in search results, choose other fields in the indexas a proxy for the vector match.\n"
