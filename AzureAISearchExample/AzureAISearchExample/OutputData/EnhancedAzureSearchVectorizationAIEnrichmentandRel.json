AI processing is achieved by adding andcombining skills in a skillset, which is then attached to anindexer.\r\nAI can be either built-in skills from Microsoft, such astext translation or Optical Character Recognition (OCR), orcustom skills that you provide.Storing enriched content foranalysis and consumption innon-search scenariosKnowledge store is persistent storage of enriched content,intended for non-search scenarios like knowledge mining anddata science processing. A knowledge store is defined in askillset, but created in Azure Storage as objects or tabularrowsets.Cached enrichmentsIncremental enrichment (preview) refers to cachedenrichments that can be reused during skillset execution.Caching is particularly valuable in skillsets that include OCRand image analysis, which are expensive to process.

Scoring profilesare used to model relevance as a function of values in thedocuments themselves.\n"
