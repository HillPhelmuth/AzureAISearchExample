A typical skillset has three to five. Themaximum is 30.A skillset can repeat skills of the same type (for example, multiple Shaper skills).\r\nA skillset supports chained operations, looping, and branching.Indexers drive skillset execution. You\u0027ll need an indexer, data source, and index beforeyou can test your skillset.Start with the basic structure. In the Create Skillset REST API, the body of the request isauthored in JSON and has the following sections:JSON\uEA80 TipEnable enrichment caching to reuse the content you\u0027ve already processed andlower the cost of development.\r\nAdd a skillset definition{   \u0022name\u0022:\u0022skillset-template\u0022,   \u0022description\u0022:\u0022A description makes the skillset self-documenting After the name and description, a skillset has four main properties:skills array, an unordered collection of skills. Skills can be utilitarian (like splittingtext), transformational (based on AI from Azure AI services), or custom skills thatyou provide. An example of a skills array is provided in the next section.cognitiveServices is used for billable skills that call Azure AI services APIs. Removethis section if you aren\u0027t using billable skills or Custom Entity Lookup. Attach aresource if you are.knowledgeStore (optional) specifies an Azure Storage account and settings forprojecting skillset output into tables, blobs, and files in Azure Storage. Remove thissection if you don\u0027t need it, otherwise specify a knowledge store.\n"
