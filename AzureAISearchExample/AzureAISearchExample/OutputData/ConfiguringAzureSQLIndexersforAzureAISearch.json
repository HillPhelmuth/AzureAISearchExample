Large views aren\u0027tideal for SQL indexer. A workaround is to create a new table just for ingestion intoyour Azure AI Search index. You\u0027ll be able to use SQL integrated change tracking,which is easier to implement than High Water Mark.\uFF17 NoteReal-time data synchronization isn\u0027t possible with an indexer. An indexer canreindex your table at most every five minutes.\n"
