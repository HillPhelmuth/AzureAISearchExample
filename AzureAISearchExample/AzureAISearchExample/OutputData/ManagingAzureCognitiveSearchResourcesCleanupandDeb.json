When inputs depend on outputs,mistakes in skillset definitions and field associations can result in missed operations anddata.Debug sessions is a tool in the Azure portal provides a holistic visualization of a skillset. Using this tool, you can drill down to specific steps to easily see where an action mightbe falling down.In this article, use Debug sessions to find and fix missing inputs and outputs. Thetutorial is all-inclusive. It provides sample data, a Postman collection that createsobjects, and instructions for debugging problems in the skillset.Before you begin, have the following prerequisites in place:An active subscription.
