  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfDepending on the datasource and your workflow, more configuration might be necessary.A supported data source that contains the content you want to ingest.An indexer data source that sets up a connection to external data.A search index that can accept incoming data.Be under the maximum limits for your service tier. The Free tier allows threeobjects of each type and 1-3 minutes of indexer processing, or 3-10 if there\u0027s askillset.When you create an indexer, the definition is one of two patterns: text-based indexingor AI enrichment with skills. The patterns are the same, except that skills-based indexinghas more definitions.\r\nPrerequisitesIndexer patternsText-based indexing for full text search is the primary use case for indexers, and for thisworkflow, an indexer looks like this example.JSONIndexers have the following requirements:A \u0022name\u0022 property that uniquely identifies the indexer in the indexer collection.A \u0022dataSourceName\u0022 property that points to a data source object. It specifies aconnection to external data.A \u0022targetIndexName\u0022 property that points to the destination search index.Other parameters are optional and modify run time behaviors, such as how many errorsto accept before failing the entire job.\r\nRequired parameters are specified in all indexersand are documented in the REST API reference.Data source-specific indexers for blobs, SQL, and Azure Cosmos DB provide extra\u0022configuration\u0022 parameters for source-specific behaviors. For example, if the source isBlob Storage, you can set a parameter that filters on file extensions: \u0022parameters\u0022 : {\u0022configuration\u0022 : { \u0022indexedFileNameExtensions\u0022 : \u0022. pdf,.docx\u0022 } }. If the source isAzure SQL, you can set a query time out parameter.Field mappings are used to explicitly map source-to-destination fields if there arediscrepancies by name or type between a field in the data source and a field in thesearch index.\n"
