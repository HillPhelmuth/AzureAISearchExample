  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfBecause sampling is an imprecise exercise, review the index for the followingconsiderations:1. Is the field list accurate? If your data source contains fields that weren\u0027t picked upin sampling, you can manually add any new fields that sampling missed, andremove any that don\u0027t add value to a search experience or that won\u0027t be used in afilter expression or scoring profile.\r\n2. Is the data type appropriate for the incoming data? Azure AI Search supports theentity data model (EDM) data types. For Azure SQL data, there\u0027s mapping chartthat lays out equivalent values. For more background, see Field mappings andtransformations.\r\n3. Do you have one field that can serve as the key? This field must be Edm.string andit must uniquely identify a document. For relational data, it might be mapped to aprimary key. For blobs, it might be the metadata-storage-path. If field valuesinclude spaces or dashes, you must set the Base-64 Encode Key option in theCreate an Indexer step, under Advanced options, to suppress the validation checkfor these characters.\r\n4. Set attributes to determine how that field is used in an index.Take your time with this step because attributes determine the physical expressionof fields in the index. If you want to change attributes later, even programmatically,you\u0027ll almost always need to drop and rebuild the index. Core attributes likeIndex schema configuration in the wizardSearchable and Retrievable have a negligible impact on storage. Enabling filtersand using suggesters increase storage requirements.Searchable enables full-text search. Every field used in free form queries or inquery expressions must have this attribute. Inverted indexes are created foreach field that you mark as Searchable.Retrievable returns the field in search results. Every field that providescontent to search results must have this attribute. Setting this field doesn\u0027tappreciably affect index size.Filterable allows the field to be referenced in filter expressions.\n"
