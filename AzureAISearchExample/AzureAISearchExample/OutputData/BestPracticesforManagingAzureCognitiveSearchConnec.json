Modifying the private endpoint in any way before this could result in anIssues approving the backing private endpointincomplete deployment operation and can cause the shared private link resource to endup (either immediately, or usually within a few hours) in a Failed state.Shared private links and private endpoints are used when search service Public NetworkAccess is Disabled. Typically, changing network connectivity should succeed in a fewminutes after the request has been accepted.\r\nIn some circumstances, Azure CognitiveSearch may take several hours to complete the connectivity change operation.If you observe that the connectivity change operation is taking a significant amount oftime, wait for a few hours. Connectivity change operations involve operations such asupdating DNS records which may take longer than expected.If Public Network Access is changed, existing shared private links and private endpointsmay not work correctly.\r\nIf existing shared private links and private endpoints stopworking during a connectivity change operation, wait a few hours for the operation tocomplete. If they\u0027re still not working, try deleting and recreating them.Typically, a shared private link resource should go a terminal state (Succeeded or Failed)in a few minutes after the request has been accepted.\r\nIn rare circumstances, Azure Cognitive Search can fail to correctly mark the state of theshared private link resource to a terminal state (Succeeded or Failed). This usuallyoccurs due to an unexpected failure.
