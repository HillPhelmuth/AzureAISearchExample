Any binary or image data in source documents should be omitted fromyour calculations.When you index documents with vector fields, Azure AI Search constructs internal vectorindexes using the algorithm parameters you provide. The size of these vector indexes isrestricted by the memory reserved for vector search for your service\u0027s tier (or SKU).The service enforces a vector index size quota for every partition in your search service.\r\nEachextra partition increases the available vector index size quota. This quota is a hard limit toensure your service remains healthy, which means that further indexing attempts once the limitis exceeded results in failure. You may resume indexing once you free up available quota byeither deleting some vector documents or by scaling up in partitions.\r\nThe table describes the vector index size quota per partition across the service tiers (or SKU).For context, it includes:Storage limits for each tier, repeated here for context.Amount of each partition (in GB) available for vector indexes (created when you addvector fields to an index).Approximate number of embeddings (floating point values) per partition.\r\nUse the Get Service Statistics API (GET /servicestats) to retrieve your vector index size quota.See our documentation on vector index size for more details.TierStorage quota(GB)Vector quota per partition(GB)Approx. floats per partition (assuming 15%overhead)Basic20. 5115 millionS1251235 millionS210061,400 millionS3200122,800 millionL11,000122,800 millionL22,000368,400 millionVector index size limitsServices created prior to July 1, 2023Services created after July 1, 2023 in supported regionsAzure AI Search is rolling out increased vector index size limits worldwide for new searchservices, but the team is building out infrastructure capacity in certain regions.\n"
