Commonscenarios include catalog or document search, data exploration, and increasingly chat-style search modalities over proprietary grounding data.\r\nWhen you create a searchservice, you\u0027ll work with the following capabilities: A search engine for full text and vector search over a search indexRich indexing, with integrated data chunking and vectorization (preview), lexicalanalysis for text, and optional AI enrichment for content extraction andtransformationRich query syntax for vector queries, text search, hybrid search, fuzzy search,autocomplete, geo-search and othersAzure scale, security, and reachAzure integration at the data layer, machine learning layer, Azure AI services andAzure OpenAIArchitecturally, a search service sits between the external data stores that contain yourun-indexed data, and your client app that sends query requests to a search index andhandles the response.\n"
