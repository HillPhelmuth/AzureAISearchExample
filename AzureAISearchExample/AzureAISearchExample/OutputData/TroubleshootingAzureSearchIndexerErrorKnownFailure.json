  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfWhen this error occurs, if you have maxFailedItems setto a value other than 0, the indexer bypasses the document on future runs so thatindexing can progress. If you can\u0027t afford to skip any document, or if you\u0027re seeing thiserror consistently, consider breaking documents into smaller documents so that partialprogress can be made within a single indexer execution.\r\nThis error occurs when the indexer is attempting to project data into a knowledge storeand there was a failure on the attempt. This failure could be consistent and fixable, or itcould be a transient failure with the projection output sink that you may need to waitand retry in order to resolve. Here\u0027s a set of known failure states and possibleresolutions.\r\nReasonDetails/ExampleResolutionCould not updateprojection blob\u0027blobUri\u0027 incontainer\u0027containerName\u0027The specified containerdoesn\u0027t exist.The indexer checks if the specified containerhas been previously created and will createit if necessary, but it only performs thischeck once per indexer run. This errormeans that something deleted the containerafter this step.\r\nTo resolve this error, try this:leave your storage account informationalone, wait for the indexer to finish, andthen rerun the indexer.Could not updateprojection blob\u0027blobUri\u0027 incontainer\u0027containerName\u0027Unable to write data tothe transport connection:An existing connectionwas forcibly closed by theremote host.
