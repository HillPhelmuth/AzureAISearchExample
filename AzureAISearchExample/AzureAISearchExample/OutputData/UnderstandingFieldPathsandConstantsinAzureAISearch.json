If you need to construct aquery with a string constant that might itself contain single quotes, you can escape theembedded quotes by doubling them.For example, a phrase with an unformatted apostrophe like \u0022Alice\u0027s car\u0022 would berepresented in OData as the string constant \u0027Alice\u0027\u0027s car\u0027.The following EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) defines the grammar for most ofthe constants shown in the above table.\n"
