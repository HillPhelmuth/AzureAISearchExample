Higher tiers alsohave much more compute power, as well as extra memory. For the same costs, youcould have more powerful infrastructure backing the same index.An important benefit of added memory is that more of the index can be cached,resulting in lower search latency, and a greater number of queries per second. With thisextra power, the administrator may not need to even need to increase the replica countand could potentially pay less than by staying on the S1 service.\r\nRegular expression queries or regex can be particularly expensive. While they can bevery useful for complex searches, they also may require a lot of processing power to beexecuted, especially if the regular expression has a lot of complexity or when searchingthrough a large amount of data. This would result in high search latency. In order toreduce the search latency, try to simplify the regular expression or break the complexquery down into smaller, more manageable queries.
