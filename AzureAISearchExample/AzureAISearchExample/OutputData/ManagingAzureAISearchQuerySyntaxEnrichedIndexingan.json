  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfHTTPThese queries illustrate a few of the ways you can work with query syntax and filters onnew fields created by Azure AI Search. For more query examples, see Examples in SearchDocuments REST API, Simple syntax query examples, and Full Lucene query examples.During early stages of development, iteration over the design is common. You will mostlikely delete and rebuild the same objects frequently.If you use the portal for deletion, and delete the indexer first, the portal will prompt youto delete the associated objects.\r\nGET /indexes//{{index_name}}/docs?search=creating boundaryless opportunities\u0026$select=content\u0026highlight=content\u0026$count=true\u0026api-version=2020-06-30 GET /indexes/{{index_name}}/docs?search=*\u0026$filter=organizations/any(organizations: organizations eq \u0027Microsoft\u0027)\u0026$select=metadata_storage_name,organizations\u0026$count=true\u0026api-version=2020-06-30Reset and rerunAlternatively, you can use DELETE and provide URLs to each object.\r\nThe followingcommand deletes an indexer.HTTPStatus code 204 is returned on successful deletion.This tutorial demonstrates the basic steps for building an enriched indexing pipelinethrough the creation of component parts: a data source, skillset, index, and indexer.\r\nBuilt-in skills were introduced, along with skillset definition and the mechanics ofchaining skills together through inputs and outputs. You also learned thatoutputFieldMappings in the indexer definition is required for routing enriched valuesfrom the pipeline into a searchable index on an Azure AI Search service.Finally, you learned how to test results and reset the system for further iterations. Youlearned that issuing queries against the index returns the output created by the enrichedindexing pipeline. When you\u0027re working in your own subscription, at the end of a project, it\u0027s a good ideato remove the resources that you no longer need. Resources left running can cost youmoney. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete theentire set of resources.You can find and manage resources in the portal, using the All resources or Resourcegroups link in the left-navigation pane.Now that you\u0027re familiar with all of the objects in an AI enrichment pipeline, let\u0027s take acloser look at skillset definitions and individual skills.DELETE https://[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME].search.windows.\n"
