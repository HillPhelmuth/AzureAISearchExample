If query and indexingrequests come from all over the world, users who are closest to the host datacenter experience faster performance. Creating more services in regions with closeproximity to these users can equalize performance for all users.If you need two or more search services, creating them in different regions can meetapplication requirements for continuity and recovery, and faster response times for aglobal user base. Azure AI Search doesn\u0027t provide an automated method of replicating search indexesacross geographic regions, but there are some techniques that can make this processsimple to implement and manage. These techniques are outlined in the next fewsections.The goal of a geo-distributed set of search services is to have two or more indexesavailable in two or more regions, where a user is routed to the Azure AI Search servicethat provides the lowest latency:You can implement this architecture by creating multiple services and designing astrategy for data synchronization. Optionally, you can include a resource like AzureTraffic Manager for routing requests.\n"
