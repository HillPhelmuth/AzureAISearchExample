Filters are set on and iterate over string and numericfields attributed as filterable in the index, but the effects of filtering determine whatthe vector query executes over: the searchable space, or the documents in the searchresults.This article describes each filter mode and provides guidance on when to use each one.Prefiltering applies filters before query execution, reducing the search surface area overwhich the vector search algorithm looks for similar content.\n"
