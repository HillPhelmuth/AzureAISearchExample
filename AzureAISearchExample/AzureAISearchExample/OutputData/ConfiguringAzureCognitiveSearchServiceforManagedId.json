A system managed identity is indicated whena connection string is the unique resource ID of an Azure AD-aware service orapplication. A user-assigned managed identity is specified through an \u0022identity\u0022property.A search service uses Azure Storage as an indexer data source and as a data sink fordebug sessions, enrichment caching, and knowledge store. For search features that writeback to storage, the managed identity needs a contributor role assignment as describedin the \u0022Assign a role\u0022 section.
