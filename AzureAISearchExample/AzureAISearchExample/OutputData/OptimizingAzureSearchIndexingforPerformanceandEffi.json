Sign in to the Azure portal and check the number of search units used by yoursearch service. Select Settings \u003E Scale to view the number at the top of the page.\r\nThe number of indexers that will run in parallel is approximately equal to thenumber of search units.2. Partition source data among multiple containers or multiple virtual folders insidethe same container.3. Create multiple data sources, one for each partition, paired to its own indexer.4. Specify the same target search index in each indexer.5. Schedule the indexers.6.\r\nReview indexer status and execution history for confirmation.There are some risks associated with parallel indexing. First, recall that indexing doesn\u0027trun in the background, increasing the likelihood that queries will be throttled ordropped.Second, Azure AI Search doesn\u0027t lock the index for updates.\r\nConcurrent writes aremanaged, invoking a retry if a particular write doesn\u0027t succeed on first attempt, but youmight notice an increase in indexing failures.Although multiple indexer-data-source sets can target the same index, be careful ofindexer runs that can overwrite existing values in the index. If a second indexer-data-source targets the same documents and fields, any values from the first run will beoverwritten. Field values are replaced in full; an indexer can\u0027t merge values from multipleruns into the same field.If you have a big data architecture and your data is on a Spark cluster, we recommendSynapseML for loading and indexing data. The tutorial includes steps for calling Azure AIservices for AI enrichment, but you can also use the AzureSearchWriter API for textindexing.Tips for improving performancePerformance analysisIndexer overviewMonitor indexer statusIndex big data on SparkSee alsoDrop and rebuild an index in AzureCognitive SearchArticle\u202202/09/2023This article explains how to drop and rebuild an Azure Cognitive Search index.\n"
