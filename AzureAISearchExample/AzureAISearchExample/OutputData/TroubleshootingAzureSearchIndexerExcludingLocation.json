Use the new code to sign in, then sendanother indexer creation request.If you are indexing content from Azure Blob Storage, and the container includes blobs ofan unsupported content type, the indexer skips that document.\r\nIn other cases, theremay be problems with individual documents.You can set configuration options to allow indexer processing to continue in the eventof problems with individual documents.HTTPIndexing unsupported document typesPUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=2020-06-30 Content-Type: application/json api-key: [admin key] {   .\r\n.. other parts of indexer definition   \u0022parameters\u0022 : { \u0022configuration\u0022 : { \u0022failOnUnsupportedContentType\u0022 : false, \u0022failOnUnprocessableDocument\u0022 : false } } } Missing documentsIndexers extract documents or rows from an external data source and create searchdocuments, which are then indexed by the search service. Occasionally, a document thatexists in data source fails to appear in a search index. This unexpected result can occurdue to the following reasons:The document was updated after the indexer was run. If your indexer is on aschedule, it eventually reruns and picks up the document.The indexer timed out before the document could be ingested. There aremaximum processing time limits after which no documents are processed. You cancheck indexer status in the portal or by calling Get Indexer Status (REST API).Field mappings or AI enrichment have changed the document and its articulationin the search index is different from what you expect.\n"
