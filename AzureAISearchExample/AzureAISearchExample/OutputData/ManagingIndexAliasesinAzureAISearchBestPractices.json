Instead of updating your code, you can update an index alias to pointto newer index versions.To minimize churn in the design process, the following table describes which elementsare fixed and flexible in the schema.\r\nChanging a fixed element requires an index rebuild,whereas flexible elements can be changed at any time without impacting the physicalimplementation.ElementCan be updated?NameNoKeyNoField names and typesNoField attributes(searchable, filterable,facetable, sortable)NoField attribute(retrievable)YesAnalyzerYou can add and modify custom analyzers in the index.\r\nRegardinganalyzer assignments on string fields, you can only modifysearchAnalyzer.

You can create an alias that maps toa search index and substitute the alias name in places where you would otherwisereference an index name. An alias adds flexibility if you need to change which index yourapplication is pointing to. Instead of updating the references in your application, youcan just update the mapping for your alias.The main goal of index aliases is to make it easier to manage your production indexes.For example, if you need to make a change to your index definition, such as editing afield or adding a new analyzer, you\u0027ll have to create a new search index because allsearch indexes are immutable.\n"
