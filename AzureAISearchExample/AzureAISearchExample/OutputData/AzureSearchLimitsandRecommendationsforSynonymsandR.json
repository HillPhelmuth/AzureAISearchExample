  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfMaximum number of synonym maps varies by tier. Each rule can have up to 20 expansions,where an expansion is an equivalent term. For example, given \u0022cat\u0022, association with \u0022kitty\u0022,\u0022feline\u0022, and \u0022felis\u0022 (the genus for cats) would count as 3 expansions.\r\n\uFF17 NoteAs stated in the Index limits, indexers will also enforce the upper limit of 3000 elementsacross all complex collections per document starting with the latest GA API version thatsupports complex types (2019-05-06) onwards. This means that if you\u0027ve created yourindexer with a prior API version, you will not be subject to this limit.\r\nTo preserve maximumcompatibility, an indexer that was created with a prior API version and then updated withan API version 2019-05-06 or later, will still be excluded from the limits. Customers shouldbe aware of the adverse impact of having very large complex collections (as statedpreviously) and we highly recommend creating any new indexers with the latest GA APIversion.\r\nShared private link resource limits1212Synonym limitsResourceFreeBasicS1S2S3S3-HDL1L2Maximum synonym maps3351020201010Maximum number of rules per map500020000200002000020000200002000020000Maximum number of index aliases varies by tier.
