  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfCollection fields are automatically set toempty (\u0027[]\u0027 in JSON) when they are omitted from a document. Also, it is not possibleto store a null value in a collection field.Unlike complex collections, there is no upper limit specifically on the number ofitems in a collection of primitive types, but the 16 MB upper limit on payload sizeapplies to all parts of documents, including collections.\r\nEdm.GeographyPolygon is a polygon representing a geographic region on the globe.While this type can\u0027t be used in document fields, it can be used as an argument to thegeo.intersects function. The literal form for URLs in OData is based on the WKT (Well-known text) and OGC\u0027s simple feature access standards.\r\nA polygon literal isconstructed as geography\u0027POLYGON((lon lat, lon lat, ...))\u0027.To learn more about geospatial search in Azure, see this video: Azure AI Search andGeospatial DataCreate IndexAdd, Update or Delete DocumentIndexer overviewCreating indexersData sources galleryOther EDM structures used in Azure AI Search\uFF09 ImportantPoints in a polygon must be in counterclockwise order.\r\nPoints in a polygon areinterpreted in counterclockwise order, relative to the inside of the polygon. Forexample, a 4-point closed polygon around London would be -0.3\u00B0W 51.6\u00B0N [topleft] , -0.3\u00B0W 51.4\u00B0N [bottom left], 0.1\u00B0E 51. 4\u00B0N [bottom right], 0.1\u00B0E 51.6\u00B0N [topright], -0.3\u00B0W 51.6\u00B0N [starting point].See alsoData type map for indexers (Azure AISearch)Article\u202211/15/2023When you\u0027re building an index schema for indexer-based indexing, the data types insource data must map to an allowed data type for the fields in the target index.\n"
