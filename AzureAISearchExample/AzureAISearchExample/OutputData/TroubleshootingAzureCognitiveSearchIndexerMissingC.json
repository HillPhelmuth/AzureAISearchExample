  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfTo extract content, the blobindexer must be configured to extract both content and metadata:HTTP\uEA80 TipIf documents are missing, check the query you are using to make sure it isn\u0027texcluding the document in question. To query for a specific document, use theLookup Document REST API.Missing content from Blob StorageAzure Cognitive Search has an implicit dependency on Azure Cosmos DB indexing.\r\nIfyou turn off automatic indexing in Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Cognitive Search returns asuccessful state, but fails to index container contents. For instructions on how to checksettings and turn on indexing, see Manage indexing in Azure Cosmos DB.Indexer may show a different document count than either the data source, the index orcount in your code, depending on specific circumstances. Here are some possible causesof why this behavior may occur:The indexer has a Deleted Document Policy. The deleted documents get countedon the indexer end if they are indexed before they get deleted.If the ID column in the data source is not unique.\r\nThis applies to data sources thathave the concept of columns, such as Azure Cosmos DB.If the data source definition has a different query than the one you are using toestimate the number of records. In example, in your data base you are querying allyour data base record count, while in the data source definition query you may beselecting just a subset of records to index.The counts are being checked in different intervals for each component of thepipeline: data source, indexer and index.The index may take some minutes to show the real document count.The data source has a file that\u0027s mapped to many documents. This condition canoccur when indexing blobs and \u0022parsingMode\u0022 is set to jsonArray and jsonLines.Due to documents processed multiple times.PUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=2020-06-30 Content-Type: application/json api-key: [admin key] {   ...\n"
