In AzureCognitive Search, this experience is supported through autocomplete, which finishes aterm or phrase based on partial input (completing \u0022micro\u0022 with \u0022microsoft\u0022). A seconduser experience is suggestions, or a short list of matching documents (returning booktitles with an ID so that you can link to a detail page about that book). Bothautocomplete and suggestions are predicated on a match in the index.\n"
