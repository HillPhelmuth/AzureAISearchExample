  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfIn this tutorial, you learned about the AzureSearchWriter transformer in SynapseML,which is a new way of creating and loading search indexes in Azure Cognitive Search.The transformer takes structured JSON as an input. The FormOntologyLearner canprovide the necessary structure for output produced by the Document Intelligencetransformers in SynapseML.As a next step, review the other SynapseML tutorials that produce transformed contentyou might want to explore through Azure Cognitive Search:Clean up resourcesNext stepsTutorial: Text Analytics with Azure AI servicesTutorial: Index Azure SQL data using the.\r\nNET SDKArticle\u202210/04/2022Configure an indexer to extract searchable data from Azure SQL Database, sending it toa search index in Azure Cognitive Search.This tutorial uses C# and the .NET SDK to perform the following tasks:If you don\u0027t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.Azure SQL DatabaseVisual StudioCreate or find an existing search serviceSource code for this tutorial is in the DotNetHowToIndexer folder in the Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started GitHub repository.This tutorial uses Azure Cognitive Search for indexing and queries, and Azure SQLDatabase as an external data source.\r\nIf possible, create both services in the same regionCreate a data source that connects to Azure SQL Database\uFF02Create an indexer\uFF02Run an indexer to load data into an index\uFF02Query an index as a verification step\uFF02Prerequisites\uFF17 NoteYou can use the free service for this tutorial. A free search service limits you to threeindexes, three indexers, and three data sources. This tutorial creates one of each.Before starting, make sure you have room on your service to accept the newresources.Download files1 - Create servicesand resource group for proximity and manageability. In practice, Azure SQL Databasecan be in any region.In this step, create an external data source on Azure SQL Database that an indexer cancrawl. You can use the Azure portal and the hotels.\n"
