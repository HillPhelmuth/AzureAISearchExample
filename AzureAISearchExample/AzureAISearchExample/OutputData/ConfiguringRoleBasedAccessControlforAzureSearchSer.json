Disabling Azure RBAC removes justthe data-related permissions associated with those roles. In a disabled-RBACscenario, Search Service Contributor is equivalent to control-plane Contributor.\r\nLimitationshappen if hundreds of unique combinations of search service resource and serviceprincipal were used within a second.Applies to: Search Index Data Contributor, Search Index Data Reader, Search ServiceContributorIn this step, configure your search service to recognize an authorization header on datarequests that provide an OAuth2 access token.\r\n1.
