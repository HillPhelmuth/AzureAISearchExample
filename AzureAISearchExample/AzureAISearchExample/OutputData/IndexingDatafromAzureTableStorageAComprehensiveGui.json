Inputs to the indexer areyour entities, in a single table. Output is a search index with searchable content andmetadata stored in individual fields.This article supplements Create an indexer with information that\u0027s specific to indexingfrom Azure Table Storage. It uses the REST APIs to demonstrate a three-part workflowcommon to all indexers: create a data source, create an index, create an indexer.\r\nDataextraction occurs when you submit the Create Indexer request.Azure Table StorageTables containing text. If you have binary data, consider AI enrichment for imageanalysis.Read permissions on Azure Storage. A \u0022full access\u0022 connection string includes akey that gives access to the content, but if you\u0027re using Azure roles, make sure thesearch service managed identity has Data and Reader permissions. Use a REST client, such as Postman app, if you want to formulate REST callssimilar to the ones shown in this article.The data source definition specifies the source data to index, credentials, and policies forchange detection. A data source is an independent resource that can be used bymultiple indexers.\n"
