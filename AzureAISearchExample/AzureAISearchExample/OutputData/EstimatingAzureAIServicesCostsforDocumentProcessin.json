  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfExample: Estimate costsAssume a pipeline that consists of document cracking of each PDF, image and textextraction, optical character recognition (OCR) of images, and entity recognition oforganizations.The prices shown in this article are hypothetical. They\u0027re used to illustrate the estimationprocess. Your costs could be lower.\r\nFor the actual price of transactions, see Azure AIservices pricing.1. For document cracking with text and image content, text extraction is currentlyfree. For 6,000 images, assume $1 for every 1,000 images extracted. That\u0027s a cost of$6.00 for this step.2. For OCR of 6,000 images in English, the OCR cognitive skill uses the best algorithm(DescribeText). Assuming a cost of $2.\r\n50 per 1,000 images to be analyzed, youwould pay $15.00 for this step.3. For entity extraction, you\u0027d have a total of three text records per page. Each recordis 1,000 characters. Three text records per page multiplied by 6,000 pages equal18,000 text records. Assuming $2.00 per 1,000 text records, this step would cost$36.00.Putting it all together, you\u0027d pay about $57.\r\n00 to ingest 1,000 PDF documents of thistype with the described skillset.Azure AI Search pricing pageHow to define a skillsetCreate Skillset (REST)How to map enriched fieldsNext stepsCreate a skillset in Azure CognitiveSearchArticle\u202208/08/2023A skillset defines the operations that extract and enrich data to make it searchable.
