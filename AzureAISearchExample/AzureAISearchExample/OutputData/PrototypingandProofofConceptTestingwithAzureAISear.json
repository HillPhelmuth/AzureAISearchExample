After the objects are created,you can review their JSON definitions in the portal or call them from code.ObjectDescriptionIndexerA configuration object specifying a data source, target index, an optional skillset,optional schedule, and optional configuration settings for error handing and base-64 encoding.\r\nData SourcePersists connection information to a supported data source on Azure. A datasource object is used exclusively with indexers.Starting the wizardObjects created by the wizardObjectDescriptionIndexPhysical data structure used for full text search and other queries.SkillsetOptional. A complete set of instructions for manipulating, transforming, andshaping content, including analyzing and extracting information from image files.Unless the volume of work fall under the limit of 20 transactions per indexer perday, the skillset must include a reference to an Azure AI multi-service resource thatprovides enrichment.\r\nKnowledgestoreOptional. Stores output from an AI enrichment pipeline in tables and blobs inAzure Storage for independent analysis or downstream processing.Before writing any code, you can use the wizard for prototyping and proof-of-concepttesting. The wizard connects to external data sources, samples the data to create aninitial index, and then imports the data as JSON documents into an index on Azure AISearch.If you\u0027re evaluating skillsets, the wizard will handle all of the output field mappings andadd helper functions to create usable objects. Text split is added if you specify a parsingmode.\r\nText merge is added if you chose image analysis so that the wizard can reunitetext descriptions with image content. Shaper skills added to support valid projections ifyou chose the knowledge store option. All of the above tasks come with a learningcurve. If you\u0027re new to enrichment, the ability to have these steps handled for you allowsyou to measure the value of a skill without having to invest much time and effort.Sampling is the process by which an index schema is inferred, and it has somelimitations. When the data source is created, the wizard picks a random sample ofdocuments to decide what columns are part of the data source.\n"
