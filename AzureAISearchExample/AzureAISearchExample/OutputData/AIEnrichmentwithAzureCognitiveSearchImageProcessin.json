You can also extract metadata about the image, such as its size.This article covers the fundamentals of working with images, and also describes severalcommon scenarios, such as working with embedded images, custom skills, andoverlaying visualizations on original images.To work with image content in a skillset, you\u0027ll need:Optionally, you can define projections to accept image-analyzed output into aknowledge store for data mining scenarios.\r\nImage processing is indexer-driven, which means that the raw inputs must be in asupported data source.Image analysis supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMPOCR supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFImages are either standalone binary files or embedded in documents (PDF, RTF, andMicrosoft application files).
