AI enrichment and image analysis are computationally intensive and consumedisproportionate amounts of available processing power. Running time for these workloads hasbeen shortened to give other jobs in the queue more opportunity to run.\r\nIndexer execution and combined indexer-skillset execution is subject to a 2-hour maximumduration. Currently, some indexers have a longer 24-hour maximum execution window, butthat behavior isn\u0027t the norm. The longer window only applies if a service or its indexers can\u0027t beinternally migrated to the newer runtime behavior.\r\nIf more than 2 hours are needed tocomplete an indexer or indexer-skillset process, schedule the indexer to run at 2-hour intervals.12365123456Indexers can access other Azure resources over private endpoints managed via the sharedprivate link resource API. This section describes the limits associated with this capability.\r\nResourceFreeBasicS1S2S3S3HDL1L2Private endpoint indexer supportNoYesYesYesYesNoYesYesPrivate endpoint support for indexers with askillsetNoNoNoYesYesNoYesYesMaximum private endpointsN/A10 or30100400400N/A2020Maximum distinct resource typesN/A471515N/A44 AI enrichment and image analysis are computationally intensive and consumedisproportionate amounts of available processing power.\r\nFor this reason, private connectionsare disabled on lower tiers to avoid an adverse impact on the performance and stability of thesearch service itself. The number of distinct resource types are computed as the number of unique groupId valuesused across all shared private link resources for a given search service, irrespective of the statusof the resource. Maximum number of synonym maps varies by tier. Each rule can have up to 20 expansions,where an expansion is an equivalent term. For example, given \u0022cat\u0022, association with \u0022kitty\u0022,\u0022feline\u0022, and \u0022felis\u0022 (the genus for cats) would count as 3 expansions.\n"
