  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThe wizard infers a schema for the built-in hotels-sample index. Follow these steps toconfigure the index:Skip configuration for cognitive skills\uEA80 TipInterested in AI enrichment? Try this Quickstart: Create a skillset in the AzureportalConfigure the index1. Accept the system-generated values for the Index name (hotels-sample-index) andKey field (HotelId).2.\r\nAccept the system-generated values for all field attributes.3. Select Next: Create an indexer to continue.At a minimum, the index requires an Index name and a collection of Fields. One fieldmust be marked as the document key to uniquely identify each document. The value isalways a string. The wizard scans for unique string fields and chooses one for the key.\r\nEach field has a name, data type, and attributes that control how to use the field in thesearch index. Checkboxes enable or disable the following attributes:Retrievable: Fields returned in a query response.Filterable: Fields that accept a filter expression.Sortable: Fields that accept an orderby expression.\r\nFacetable: Fields used in a faceted navigation structure.\uFF09 ImportantIf you rerun the wizard and use an existing hotels-sample data source, theindex isn\u0027t configured with default attributes. You have to manually selectattributes on future imports.Searchable: Fields used in full text search. Strings are searchable. Numeric fieldsand Boolean fields are often marked as not searchable.\r\nStrings are attributed as Retrievable and Searchable. Integers are attributed asRetrievable, Filterable, Sortable, and Facetable.Attributes affect storage. Filterable fields consume extra storage, but Retrievabledoesn\u0027t. For more information, see Example demonstrating the storage implications ofattributes and suggesters. If you want autocomplete or suggested queries, specify language Analyzers orSuggesters.The last step configures and runs the indexer. This object defines an executable process.The data source, index, and indexer are created in this step.1. Accept the system-generated value for the Indexer name (hotels-sample-indexer).2. For this quickstart, use the default option to run the indexer once, immediately.The hosted data is static so there\u0027s no change tracking enabled for it.3. Select Submit to create and simultaneously run the indexer.Configure and run the indexerYou can monitor creation of the indexer or index in the portal.\n"
