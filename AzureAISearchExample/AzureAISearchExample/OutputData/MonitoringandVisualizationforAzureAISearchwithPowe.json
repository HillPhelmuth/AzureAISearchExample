The template can help yougain detailed insights about your search service, including information about queries,indexing, operations, and service metrics.You can find the Power BI Template App Azure AI Search: Analyze Logs and Metrics inthe Power BI Apps marketplace.1. Enable metric and resource logging for your search service:a. Create or identify an existing Azure Storage account where you can archive thelogs.b. Navigate to your Azure AI Search service in the Azure portal.c. Under the Monitoring section on the left column, select Diagnostic settings. d. Select \u002B Add diagnostic setting.e. Check Archive to a storage account, provide your Storage account information,and check OperationLogs and AllMetrics.Set up the appf. Select Save.2. After logging has been enabled, use your search service to start generating logsand metrics. It takes up to an hour before the containers will appear in Blobstorage with these logs. You will see a insights-logs-operationlogs container forsearch traffic logs and a insights-metrics-pt1m container for metrics.3. Find the Azure AI Search Power BI App in the Power BI Apps marketplace andinstall it into a new workspace or an existing workspace.\n"
