Unscored results occur whenthe query form is fuzzy search, wildcard or regex queries, or an empty search (search=*).If you need to impose a ranking structure over unscored results, consider an $orderbyexpression to achieve that objective.If you\u0027re using semantic search, the \u0022@search.rerankerScore\u0022 determines the sort orderof your results.The \u0022@search.rerankerScore\u0022 range is 1 to 4.00, where a higher score indicates astronger semantic match.If consistent ordering is an application requirement, you can define an $orderbyexpression on a field.\n"
