If your content consists of translated strings, such as separate fields for Englishand Chinese text, you could specify language analyzers on each field to access the richlinguistic capabilities of those analyzers.You should consider a language analyzer when awareness of word or sentence structureadds value to text parsing. A common example is the association of irregular verb forms(\u0022bring\u0022 and \u0022brought) or plural nouns (\u0022mice\u0022 and \u0022mouse\u0022). Without linguisticawareness, these strings are parsed on physical characteristics alone, which fails to catchthe connection. Since large chunks of text are more likely to have this content, fieldsconsisting of descriptions, reviews, or summaries are good candidates for a languageanalyzer.You should also consider language analyzers when content consists of non-Westernlanguage strings. While the default analyzer (Standard Lucene) is language-agnostic, theconcept of using spaces and special characters (hyphens and slashes) to separate stringsis more applicable to Western languages than non-Western ones.For example, in Chinese, Japanese, Korean (CJK), and other Asian languages, a spaceisn\u0027t necessarily a word delimiter. Consider the following Japanese string.\n"
