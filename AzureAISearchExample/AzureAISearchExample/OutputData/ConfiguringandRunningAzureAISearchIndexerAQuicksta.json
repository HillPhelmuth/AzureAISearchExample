For this quickstart, use the default option to run the indexer once, immediately.The hosted data is static so there\u0027s no change tracking enabled for it.3.

Existing fields have a physical representation in theindex so they aren\u0027t modifiable, not even in code. To fundamentally change an existingfield, you need to create a new field that replaces the original. Other constructs, such asscoring profiles and CORS options, can be added to an index at any time.To clearly understand what you can and can\u0027t edit during index design, take a minute toview the index definition options. Grayed options in the field list indicate values thatcan\u0027t be modified or deleted.\n"
