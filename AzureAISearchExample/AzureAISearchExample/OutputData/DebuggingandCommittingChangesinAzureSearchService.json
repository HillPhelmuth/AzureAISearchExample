  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfWhen the debug session was initiated, the search service created a copy of the skillset.This was done to protect the original skillset on your search service. Now that you havefinished debugging your skillset, the fixes can be committed (overwrite the originalskillset).Alternatively, if you aren\u0027t ready to commit changes, you can save the debug sessionand reopen it later.\r\n1. Select Commit changes in the main Debug sessions menu.2. Select OK to confirm that you wish to update your skillset.3. Close Debug session and open Indexers from the left navigation pane.4. Select \u0027clinical-trials-idxr\u0027.5. Select Reset.6. Select Run.7. Select Refresh to show the status of the reset and run commands.\r\nWhen the indexer has finished running, there should be a green checkmark and theword Success next to the time stamp for the latest run in the Execution history tab. Toensure that the changes have been applied:1. In the left navigation pane, open Indexes.2.\r\nSelect \u0027clinical-trials\u0027 index and in the Search explorer tab, enter this query string:$select=metadata_storage_path, organizations, locations\u0026$count=true to returnfields for specific documents (identified by the unique metadata_storage_pathfield).3. Select Search.The results should show that organizations and locations are now populated with theexpected values.\r\nCommit changes to the skillsetClean up resourcesWhen you\u0027re working in your own subscription, it\u0027s a good idea at the end of a projectto identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running cancost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group todelete the entire set of resources. You can find and manage resources in the portal, using the All resources or Resourcegroups link in the left-navigation pane.If you\u0027re using a free service, remember that you\u0027re limited to three indexes, indexers,and data sources. You can delete individual items in the portal to stay under the limit.This tutorial touched on various aspects of skillset definition and processing.\n"
