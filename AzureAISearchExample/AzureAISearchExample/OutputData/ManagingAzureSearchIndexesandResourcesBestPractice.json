In our example, both data sources contain aHotelName field.\r\nIf for some reason the data in this field is different, for documentswith the same key value, then the HotelName data from the data source that wasindexed most recently will be the value stored in the index.5 - SearchIn Azure portal, open the search service Overview page, and find the hotel-rooms-sample index in the Indexes list.\r\nSelect on the hotel-rooms-sample index in the list. You\u0027ll see a Search Explorer interfacefor the index. Enter a query for a term like \u0022Luxury\u0022. You should see at least onedocument in the results, and this document should show a list of room objects in itsrooms array.\r\nIn the early experimental stages of development, the most practical approach for designiteration is to delete the objects from Azure AI Search and allow your code to rebuildthem. Resource names are unique. Deleting an object lets you recreate it using the samename.The sample code checks for existing objects and deletes or updates them so that youcan rerun the program. You can also use the portal to delete indexes, indexers, and data sources.When you\u0027re working in your own subscription, at the end of a project, it\u0027s a good ideato remove the resources that you no longer need. Resources left running can cost youmoney. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete theentire set of resources.You can find and manage resources in the portal, using the All resources or Resourcegroups link in the left-navigation pane.Now that you\u0027re familiar with the concept of ingesting data from multiple sources, let\u0027stake a closer look at indexer configuration, starting with Azure Cosmos DB.\n"
