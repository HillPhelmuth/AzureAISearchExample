Vector fields can co-exist with nonvectorfields in the same search document.Vector queriesFormulate single and multiple vector queries.\r\nVector search algorithmsUse Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) or exhaustiveK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find similar vectors in a searchindex.Vector filtersApply filters before or after query execution for greaterprecision during information retrieval.Hybrid information retrievalSearch for concepts and keywords in a single hybrid queryrequest.Hybrid search consolidates vector and text search, withoptional semantic ranking and relevance tuning for bestresults.Integrated data chunking andvectorization (preview)Native data chunking through Text Split skill and nativevectorization through vectorizers and theAzureOpenAIEmbeddingModel skill.
