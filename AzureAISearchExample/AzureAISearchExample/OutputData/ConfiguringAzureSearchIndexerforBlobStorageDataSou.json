  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfAn indexer data source definition includes a \u0022query\u0022parameter that can take a virtual folder. If you specify a virtual folder, only thoseblobs in the folder are indexed.Include or exclude blobs by file type. The supported document formats list canhelp you determine which blobs to exclude. For example, you might want toexclude image or audio files that don\u0027t provide searchable text.\r\nThis capability iscontrolled through configuration settings in the indexer.Include or exclude arbitrary blobs. If you want to skip a specific blob for whateverreason, you can add the following metadata properties and values to blobs in BlobStorage. When an indexer encounters this property, it skips the blob or its contentin the indexing run.\r\nSupported document formatsDetermine which blobs to indexProperty namePropertyvalueExplanationProperty namePropertyvalueExplanation\u0022AzureSearch_Skip\u0022\u0022true\u0022Instructs the blob indexer to completely skip theblob. Neither metadata nor content extraction isattempted. This is useful when a particular blobfails repeatedly and interrupts the indexingprocess.\r\n\u0022AzureSearch_SkipContent\u0022\u0022true\u0022Skips content and extracts just the metadata. thisis equivalent to the \u0022dataToExtract\u0022 :\u0022allMetadata\u0022 setting described in configurationsettings , just scoped to a particular blob.If you don\u0027t set up inclusion or exclusion criteria, the indexer will report an ineligibleblob as an error and move on.\r\nIf enough errors occur, processing might stop. You canspecify error tolerance in the indexer configuration settings.An indexer typically creates one search document per blob, where the text content andmetadata are captured as searchable fields in an index. If blobs are whole files, you canpotentially parse them into multiple search documents. For example, you can parse rowsin a CSV file to create one search document per row.A compound or embedded document (such as a ZIP archive, a Word document withembedded Outlook email containing attachments, or an .MSG file with attachments) isalso indexed as a single document. For example, all images extracted from theattachments of an .\n"
