For this quickstart, we\u0027re using the Free Azure AI services resource. The sampledata consists of 14 files, so the free allotment of 20 transaction on Azure AIservices is sufficient for this quickstart.2. Expand Add enrichments and make six selections.

In this step, review the generatedschema and potentially revise any settings.For this quickstart, the wizard does a good job setting reasonable defaults:Default fields are based on metadata properties of existing blobs, plus the newfields for the enrichment output (for example, people, organizations, locations).\n"
