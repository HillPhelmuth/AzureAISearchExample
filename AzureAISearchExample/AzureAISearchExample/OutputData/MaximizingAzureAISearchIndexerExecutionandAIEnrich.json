Until indexer execution starts, dependent objects such as data sources,indexes, and skillsets are passive on the search service.For more information, see Create an indexerAfter the first indexer run, you can rerun it on demand or set up a schedule.\r\nYou can monitor indexer status in the portal or through Get Indexer Status API. Youshould also run queries on the index to verify the result is what you expected.Indexers don\u0027t have dedicated processing resources. Based on this, indexers\u0027 status mayshow as idle before running (depending on other jobs in the queue) and run times mayStep 2: Create an indexStep 3: Create and run (or schedule) the indexernot be predictable.\r\nOther factors define indexer performance as well, such as documentsize, document complexity, image analysis, among others.Now that you\u0027ve been introduced to indexers, a next step is to review indexer propertiesand parameters, scheduling, and indexer monitoring.

Because Azure AI Search is a full text search solution, the purpose of AI enrichment is toimprove the utility of your content in search-related scenarios:Apply translation and language detection for multi-lingual searchApply entity recognition to extract people names, places, and other entities fromlarge chunks of textApply key phrase extraction to identify and output important termsApply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize printed and handwrittentext in binary filesApply image analysis to describe image content, and output the descriptions assearchable text fieldsAI enrichment is an extension of an indexer pipeline that connects to Azure datasources.\n"
