  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThis is acceptable because there are so few documents in thedemo data source. For a larger data source, you would set the value to greater than 0.The \u0022dataToExtract\u0022:\u0022contentAndMetadata\u0022 statement tells the indexer to automaticallyextract the values from the blob\u0027s content property and the metadata of each object.\r\nWhen content is extracted, you can set imageAction to extract text from images found inthe data source. The \u0022imageAction\u0022:\u0022generateNormalizedImages\u0022 configuration,combined with the OCR Skill and Text Merge Skill, tells the indexer to extract text fromthe images (for example, the word \u0022stop\u0022 from a traffic Stop sign), and embed it as partof the content field. This behavior applies to both embedded images (think of an imageinside a PDF) and standalone image files, for instance a JPG file.Indexing and enrichment commence as soon as you submit the Create Indexer request.\r\nDepending on which cognitive skills you defined, indexing can take a while.  {      \u0022dataToExtract\u0022: \u0022contentAndMetadata\u0022,      \u0022imageAction\u0022: \u0022generateNormalizedImages\u0022  }  }}\uFF17 NoteCreating an indexer invokes the pipeline. If there are problems reaching the data,mapping inputs and outputs, or order of operations, they appear at this stage.\r\nTore-run the pipeline with code or script changes, you might need to drop objectsfirst. For more information, see Reset and re-run.About indexer parameters4 - Monitor indexingTo find out whether the indexer is still running, call Get Indexer Status to check theindexer status. 1. Select and then send the \u0022Check indexer status\u0022 request.2. Review the response to learn whether the indexer is running, or to view error andwarning information.Warnings are common in some scenarios and do not always indicate a problem. Forexample, if a blob container includes image files, and the pipeline doesn\u0027t handleimages, you\u0027ll get a warning stating that images were not processed.In this sample, there is a PNG file that contains no text. All five of the text-based skills(language detection, entity recognition of locations, organizations, people, and keyphrase extraction) fail to execute on this file.\n"
