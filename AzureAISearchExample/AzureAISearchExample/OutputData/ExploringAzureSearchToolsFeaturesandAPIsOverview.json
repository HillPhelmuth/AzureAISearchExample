After saving the index, you can populate it using anSDK or the REST API to provide the data.\r\nImport data wizard creates indexes, indexers, skillsets, and datasource definitions. If your data exists in Azure, this wizard can saveyou significant time and effort, especially for proof-of-conceptinvestigation and exploration.Search explorer is used to test queries and refine scoring profiles.Create demo app is used to generate an HTML page that can beused to test the search experience.\r\nDebug Sessions is a visual editor that lets you debug a skillsetPortal featuresCategory\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Featuresinteractively.
