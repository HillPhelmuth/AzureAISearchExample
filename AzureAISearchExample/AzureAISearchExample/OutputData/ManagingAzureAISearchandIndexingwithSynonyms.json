You can delete the resource group now topermanently delete everything in it. In the portal, the resource group name is on theOverview page of Azure AI Search service.This example demonstrated the synonyms feature in C# code to create and postmapping rules and then call the synonym map on a query.\r\nAdditional information canbe found in the .NET SDK and REST API reference documentation.Name: Fancy Stay        Category: Luxury        Tags: [pool, view, wifi, concierge]Search the entire index for the terms \u0027economy\u0027 AND \u0027hotel\u0027:Name: Roach Motel       Category: Budget        Tags: [motel, budget]Clean up resourcesNext stepsHow to use synonyms in Azure AI SearchCreate an indexer in Azure CognitiveSearchArticle\u202210/05/2023Use an indexer to automate data import and indexing in Azure Cognitive Search.\r\nAnindexer is a named object on a search service that connects to an external Azure datasource, reads data, and passes it to a search engine for indexing.\r\nUsing indexerssignificantly reduces the quantity and complexity of the code you need to write if you\u0027reusing a supported data source.Indexers support two workflows:Text-based indexing, extract strings and metadata from textual content for full textsearch scenarios.Skills-based indexing, using built-in or custom skills that add integrated machinelearning for analysis over images and large undifferentiated content, extracting orinferring text and structure. Skill-based indexing enables search over content thatisn\u0027t otherwise easily full text searchable. To learn more, see AI enrichment inCognitive Search.This article focuses on the basic steps of creating an indexer. Depending on the datasource and your workflow, more configuration might be necessary.A supported data source that contains the content you want to ingest.An indexer data source that sets up a connection to external data.A search index that can accept incoming data.Be under the maximum limits for your service tier. The Free tier allows threeobjects of each type and 1-3 minutes of indexer processing, or 3-10 if there\u0027s askillset.When you create an indexer, the definition is one of two patterns: text-based indexingor AI enrichment with skills. The patterns are the same, except that skills-based indexinghas more definitions.\n"
