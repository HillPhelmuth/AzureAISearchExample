Suggesters add to the number of tokenizedterms in your index, and thus consume more storage.\r\nThe last page of the wizard collects user inputs for indexer configuration.

For fields of this configuration, analysis occurs during indexing when tokens are created,and then again during query execution when queries are parsed and the engine scansfor matching tokens. A match is more likely to occur when the same analyzer is used forboth indexing and queries, but you can set the analyzer for each workloadindependently, depending on your requirements.\n"
