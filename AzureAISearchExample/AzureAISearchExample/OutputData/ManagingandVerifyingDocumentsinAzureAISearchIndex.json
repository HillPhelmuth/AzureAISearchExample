  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfIndexData(indexClient, hotels, 1000, 8);[Batch starting at doc 6000 had partial failure][Retrying 560 failed documents]After the function is finished running, you can verify that all of the documents wereadded to the index.You can explore the populated search index after the program has run programaticallyor using the Search explorer in the portal.There are two main options for checking the number of documents in an index: theCount Documents API and the Get Index Statistics API. Both paths may require someadditional time to update so don\u0027t be alarmed if the number of documents returned islower than you expected initially.\r\nThe Count Documents operation retrieves a count of the number of documents in asearch index:C#The Get Index Statistics operation returns a document count for the current index, plusstorage usage. Index statistics will take longer than document count to update.C#In Azure portal, open the search service Overview page, and find the optimize-indexingindex in the Indexes list.\r\n6 - Explore indexProgramaticallyCount Documentslong indexDocCount = await searchClient.GetDocumentCountAsync();Get Index Statisticsvar indexStats = await indexClient.GetIndexStatisticsAsync(indexName);Azure portalThe Document Count and Storage Size are based on Get Index Statistics API and maytake several minutes to update. In the early experimental stages of development, the most practical approach for designiteration is to delete the objects from Azure AI Search and allow your code to rebuildthem. Resource names are unique. Deleting an object lets you recreate it using the samename.The sample code for this tutorial checks for existing indexes and deletes them so thatyou can rerun your code.You can also use the portal to delete indexes.When you\u0027re working in your own subscription, at the end of a project, it\u0027s a good ideato remove the resources that you no longer need. Resources left running can cost youmoney.\n"
