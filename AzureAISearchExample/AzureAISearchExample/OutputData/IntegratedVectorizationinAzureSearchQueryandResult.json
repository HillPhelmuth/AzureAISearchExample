The vectorizer provides connection information to an embedding model used atquery time.Queries provide text strings instead of vectors:kind must be set to text .\r\ntext must have a text string. It\u0027s passed to the vectorizer assigned to the vectorfield.fields is the vector field to search.Here\u0027s a simple example of a query that\u0027s vectorized at query time.
