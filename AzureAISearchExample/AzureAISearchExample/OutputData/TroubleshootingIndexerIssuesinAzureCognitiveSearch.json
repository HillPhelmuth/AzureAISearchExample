If you have an error to investigate,see Troubleshooting common indexer errors and warnings instead.For data sources that are secured by Azure network security mechanisms, indexers havea limited set of options for making the connection. Currently, indexers can accessrestricted data sources behind an IP firewall or on a virtual network through a privateendpoint.Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL provide a configurable firewall. There\u0027sno specific error message when the firewall is enabled. Typically, firewall errors aregeneric.\r\nSome common errors include:The remote server returned an error: (403) ForbiddenThis request is not authorized to perform this operationCredentials provided in the connection string are invalid or have expiredThere are two options for allowing indexers to access these resources in such aninstance:Disable the firewall, by allowing access from All Networks (if feasible).Alternatively, you can allow access for the IP address of your search service and theIP address range of AzureCognitiveSearch service tag in the firewall rules of yourresource (IP address range restriction). Details for configuring IP address range restrictions for each data source type can befound from the following links:Azure StorageTroubleshoot connections to restrictedresourcesFirewall rulesAzure Cosmos DBAzure SQLLimitation: IP address range restrictions only work if your search service, and yourstorage account are in different regions.Azure functions (that could be used as a Custom Web Api skill) also support IP addressrestrictions.\n"
