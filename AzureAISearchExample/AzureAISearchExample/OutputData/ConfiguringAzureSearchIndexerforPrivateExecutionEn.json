For a private connection, configure indexer execution to always run in theprivate environment.\r\nThis step shows you how to configure the indexer to run in the private environmentusing the REST API. You can also set the execution environment using the JSON editor inthe portal.az rest --method get --uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.\r\nSearch/searchServices/contoso-search/sharedPrivateLinkResources/blob-pe?api-version=2022-09-01{      \u0022name\u0022: \u0022blob-pe\u0022,      \u0022properties\u0022: {        \u0022privateLinkResourceId\u0022: \u0022/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso/providers/Microsoft.\r\nStorage/storageAccounts/contoso-storage\u0022,        \u0022groupId\u0022: \u0022blob\u0022,        \u0022requestMessage\u0022: \u0022please approve\u0022,        \u0022status\u0022: \u0022Approved\u0022,        \u0022resourceRegion\u0022: null,        \u0022provisioningState\u0022: \u0022Succeeded\u0022      }}4 - Configure the indexer to run in the privateenvironment1. Create the data source definition, index, and skillset (if you\u0027re using one) as youwould normally. There are no properties in any of these definitions that vary whenusing a shared private endpoint.2. Create an indexer that points to the data source, index, and skillset that youcreated in the preceding step. In addition, force the indexer to run in the privateexecution environment by setting the indexer executionEnvironment configurationproperty to private.\n"
