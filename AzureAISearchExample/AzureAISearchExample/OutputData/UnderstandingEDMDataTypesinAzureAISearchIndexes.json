Precision of DateTimeOffsetfields is limited to milliseconds.\r\nIf you upload DateTimeOffsetvalues with submillisecond precision, the value returned isrounded up to milliseconds (for example, 2015-04-15T10:30:09.7552052Z is returned as 2015-04-15T10:30:09.7550000Z). When you upload DateTimeOffsetvalues with time zone information to your index, Azure AISearch normalizes these values to UTC. For example, 2017-01-13T14:03:00-08:00 is stored as 2017-01-13T22:03:00Z.\r\nIf you\uFF17 NoteIf you\u0027re using indexers to pull data into Azure AI Search, indexers have differentdata type mappings for JSON and SQL Server data sources.

Forrequest and response bodies, the representation of values ofthis type follows the GeoJSON \u0022Point\u0022 type format. For URLs,OData uses a literal form based on the WKT standard. A pointliteral is constructed as geography\u0027POINT(lon lat)\u0027.Edm. ComplexTypeObjects whose properties map to subfields that can be of anyother supported data type. This type enables indexing ofstructured hierarchical data such as JSON. Objects in a field oftype Edm.ComplexType can contain nested objects, but the levelof nesting is limited. The limits are described in Service limits.Collection(Edm.String)A list of strings.Collection(Edm.\n"
