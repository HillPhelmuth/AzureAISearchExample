As a developer, facets let you expose the most useful search criteria fornavigating your search index.\r\nFaceting is enabled on a field-by-field basis in an index definition when you set the\u0022facetable\u0022 attribute to true.Although it\u0027s not strictly required, you should also set the \u0022filterable\u0022 attribute so thatyou can build the necessary filters that back the faceted navigation experience in yoursearch application.\r\nThe following example of the \u0022hotels\u0022 sample index shows \u0022facetable\u0022 and \u0022filterable\u0022 onlow cardinality fields that contain single values or short phrases: \u0022Category\u0022, \u0022Tags\u0022,\u0022Rating\u0022.JSONEnable facets in the index{  \u0022name\u0022: \u0022hotels\u0022,    \u0022fields\u0022: [    { \u0022name\u0022: \u0022hotelId\u0022, \u0022type\u0022: \u0022Edm.String\u0022, \u0022key\u0022: true, \u0022searchable\u0022: Facets can be calculated over single-value fields as well as collections.\r\nFields that workbest in faceted navigation have these characteristics:Low cardinality (a small number of distinct values that repeat throughoutdocuments in your search corpus)Short descriptive values (one or two words) that will render nicely in a navigationtreeThe values within a field, and not the field name itself, produces the facets in a facetednavigation structure. If the facet is a string field named Color, facets will be blue, green,and any other value for that field.As a best practice, check fields for null values, misspellings or case discrepancies, andsingle and plural versions of the same word. By default, filters and facets don\u0027t undergolexical analysis or spell check, which means that all values of a \u0022facetable\u0022 field arepotential facets, even if the words differ by one character. Optionally, you can assign anormalizer to a \u0022filterable\u0022 and \u0022facetable\u0022 field to smooth out variations in casing andcharacters.If you are using one of the Azure SDKs, your code must explicitly set the field attributes.\n"
