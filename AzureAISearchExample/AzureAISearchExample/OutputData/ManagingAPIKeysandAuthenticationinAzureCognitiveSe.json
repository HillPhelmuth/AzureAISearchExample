An API key is a unique string composed of 52 randomly generatednumbers and letters. A request made to a search service endpoint will be accepted ifboth the request and the API key are valid.\r\nThere are two kinds of keys used for authenticating a request:TypePermission levelMaximumHow createdAdminFull access (read-write)for all contentoperations2 Two admin keys, referred to as primary andsecondary keys in the portal, are generatedwhen the service is created and can beindividually regenerated on demand.\r\nQueryRead-only access,scoped to thedocuments collection ofa search index50One query key is generated with the service.More can be created on demand by a searchservice administrator. Having two allows you to roll over one key while using the second key for continuedaccess to the service.Visually, there\u0027s no distinction between an admin key or query key.\r\nBoth keys are stringscomposed of 52 randomly generated alpha-numeric characters. If you lose track of whattype of key is specified in your application, you can check the key values in the portal.\uFF17 NoteA quick note about how \u0022key\u0022 terminology is used in Cognitive Search.
