In the Azure AI Search index, searchresults will fall easily into hotel-based entities, while preserving the context of individualrooms and their attributes.Fields that have a parent, such as the fields under Address and Rooms, are calledsubfields.\r\nAlthough you can assign a \u0022facetable\u0022 attribute to a subfield, the count of thefacet will always be for the main document.For complex types like Address, where there\u0027s just one \u0022Address/City\u0022 or\u0022Address/stateProvince\u0022 in the document, the facet behavior works as expected.However, in the case of Rooms, where there are multiple subdocuments for each maindocument, the facet counts can be misleading.\r\nAs noted in Model complex types: \u0022the document counts returned in the facet resultsare calculated for the parent document (a hotel), not the subdocuments in a complexcollection (rooms). For example, suppose a hotel has 20 rooms of type \u0022suite\u0022. Given thisfacet parameter facet=Rooms/Type, the facet count is one for the hotel, not 20 for therooms. \u0022Using your own data set, you can use the Import data wizard to create and load theindex. The wizard detects the embedded JSON collection, such as the one contained inRooms, and infers an index schema that includes a complex type collection.  ]}Facet behavior on complex type subfieldsNext stepsTry the following quickstart to learn the basic steps of the Import data wizard.\n"
