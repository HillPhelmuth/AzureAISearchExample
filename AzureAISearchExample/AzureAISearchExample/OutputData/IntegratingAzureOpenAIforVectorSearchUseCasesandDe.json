  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfDemos in the sample repositorytap the similarity embedding models of Azure OpenAI.Dimension attributes have a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 2048 dimensions pervector field.Query inputs require that you submit user-provided input to an embedding modelthat quickly converts human readable text into a vector.\r\nFor example, you can use text-embedding-ada-002 to generate textembeddings and Image Retrieval REST API for image embeddings.To avoid rate limiting, you can implement retry logic in your workload. For thePython demo, we used tenacity.Query outputs are any matching documents found in a search index. Your searchindex must have been previously loaded with documents having one or morevector fields with embeddings.\r\nWhatever model you used for indexing, use thesame model for queries.\uFF17 NoteThis article applies to the generally available version of vector search, whichassumes your application code calls an external resource such as Azure OpenAI forvectorization. A new feature called integrated vectorization, currently in preview,offers embedded vectorization. Integrated vectorization takes a dependency onindexers, skillsets, and either the AzureOpenAIEmbedding skill or a custom skill thatpoints to a model that executes externally from Azure AI Search.How models are usedCreate resources in the same regionIf you want resources in the same region, start with:1. A region for the similarity embedding model, currently in Europe and the UnitedStates.2. A region for Azure AI Search.3. To support hybrid queries that include semantic ranking, or if you want to trymachine learning model integration using a custom skill in an AI enrichmentpipeline, note the regions that provide those features.The Postman collection assumes that you already have a vector query. Here\u0027s somePython code for generating an embedding that you can paste into the \u0022values\u0022 propertyof a vector query.PythonIdentify use cases: Evaluate the specific use cases where embedding modelintegration for vector search features can add value to your search solution.\n"
