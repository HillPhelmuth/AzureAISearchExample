  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfFilters are also used internally to expose slices of indexed content. For example,you might initialize a search page using a filter on a product category, or a language ifan index contains fields in both English and French.You might also need filters to invoke a specialized query form, as described in thefollowing table.\r\nYou can use a filter with an unspecified search (search=*) or with aquery string that includes terms, phrases, operators, and patterns.FilterscenarioDescriptionRange filtersIn Azure AI Search, range queries are built using the filter parameter. For moreinformation and examples, see Range filter example.\r\nFacetednavigationIn faceted navigation tree, users can select facets. When backed by filters, searchresults narrow on each click. Each facet is backed by a filter that excludesdocuments that no longer match the criteria provided by the facet.Geospatial search matches on a location\u0027s latitude and longitude coordinates for \u0022findnear me\u0022 or map-based search experience.\r\nIn Azure AI Search, you can implementgeospatial search by following these steps:Define a filterable field of one of these types: Edm.GeographyPoint,Collection(Edm.GeographyPoint, Edm.GeographyPolygon).Filter search\uFF17 NoteText that\u0027s used in a filter expression is not analyzed during query processing.\r\nThetext input is presumed to be a verbatim case-sensitive character pattern that eithersucceeds or fails on the match. Filter expressions are constructed using ODatasyntax and passed in a filter parameter in all filterable fields in your index. Formore information, see Filters in Azure AI Search.Geospatial searchVerify the incoming documents include the appropriate coordinates. After indexing is complete, build a query that uses a filter and a geo-spatialfunction.Geospatial search uses kilometers for distance. Coordinates are specified in this format:(longitude, latitude).Here\u0027s an example of a filter for geospatial search. This filter finds other Location fieldsin the search index that have coordinates within a 300-kilometer radius of thegeography point (in this example, Washington D.C.). It returns address information inthe result, and includes an optional facets clause for self-navigation based on location.HTTPFor more information and examples, see Geospatial search example.\n"
