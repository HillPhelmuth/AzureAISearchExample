If the calls weren\u0027tsuccessful, the most likely reason if the static web app configurations for the APIendpoint name and Search query key are incorrect.\r\nTo clean up the resources created in this tutorial, delete the resource group.1. In Visual Studio Code, open the Activity bar, and select the Azure icon.2. In the Side bar, right-click on your Azure subscription under the Resource Groupsarea and find the resource group you created for this tutorial.3. Right-click the resource group name then select Delete.\r\nThis deletes both theSearch and Static Web Apps resources.4. If you no longer want the GitHub fork of the sample, remember to delete that onGitHub. Go to your fork\u0027s Settings then delete the fork.Understand Search integration for the search-enabled websiteClean up resourcesNext steps4 - Explore the Python search codeArticle\u202209/21/2023In the previous lessons, you added search to a Static Web App.\r\nThis lesson highlights theessential steps that establish integration. If you\u0027re looking for a cheat sheet on how tointegrate search into your Python app, this article explains what you need to know.The application is available:SampleDemo website - aka. ms/azs-good-booksThe Function app uses the Azure SDK for Cognitive Search:PYPI package azure-search-documentsReference DocumentationThe Function app authenticates through the SDK to the cloud-based Cognitive SearchAPI using your resource name, API key, and index name. The secrets are stored in theStatic Web App settings and pulled in to the Function as environment variables.\n"
