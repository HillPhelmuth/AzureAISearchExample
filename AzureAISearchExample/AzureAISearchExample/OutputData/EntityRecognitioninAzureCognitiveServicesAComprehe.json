Theseentities fall under 14 distinct categories, ranging from people and organizations to URLsand phone numbers. This skill uses the Named Entity Recognition machine learningmodels provided by Azure Cognitive Services for Language.\r\nMicrosoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityRecognitionSkillThe maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured byString.Length. If you need to break up your data before sending it to theEntityRecognition skill, consider using the Text Split skill. When using a split skill, set thepage length to 5000 for the best performance. Parameters are case-sensitive and are all optional.Parameter nameDescriptioncategoriesArray of categories that should be extracted.
