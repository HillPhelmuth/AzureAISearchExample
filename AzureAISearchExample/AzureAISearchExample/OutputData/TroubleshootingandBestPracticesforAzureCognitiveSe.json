Running an indexer using a schedule is the preferred recommendation.If you have sensitivity labels set on documents, you might not be able to index them. Ifyou\u0027re getting errors, remove the labels prior to indexing.\r\nTroubleshooting common indexer errors and warningsMonitor indexer-based indexingIndexing documents with sensitivity labelsSee alsoTroubleshooting common indexer errorsand warnings in Azure Cognitive SearchArticle\u202209/29/2023This article provides information and solutions to common errors and warnings youmight encounter during indexing and AI enrichment in Azure Cognitive Search.Indexing stops when the error count exceeds \u0027maxFailedItems\u0027. If you want indexers to ignore these errors (and skip over \u0022failed documents\u0022), considerupdating the maxFailedItems and maxFailedItemsPerBatch as described here.The error information in this article can help you resolve errors, allowing indexing tocontinue.Warnings don\u0027t stop indexing, but they do indicate conditions that could result inunexpected outcomes. Whether you take action or not depends on the data and yourscenario.\n"
