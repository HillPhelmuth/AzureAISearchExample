The built-in is for logging and monitoring. By using this built-indefinition in a policy that you create, the system will scan for search services that do nothave resource logging, and then enable it accordingly.Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy provides Microsoft-created and managedinitiative definitions, known as built-ins, for the compliance domains and securitycontrols related to different compliance standards.\r\nThis page lists the compliancedomains and security controls for Azure AI Search. You can assign the built-ins for asecurity control individually to help make your Azure resources compliant with thespecific standard.The title of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azureportal. Use the link in the Policy Version column to view the source on the Azure PolicyGitHub repo.\uFF09 ImportantEach control is associated with one or more Azure Policy definitions. These policiesmight help you assess compliance with the control. However, there often isn\u0027t aone-to-one or complete match between a control and one or more policies. Assuch, Compliant in Azure Policy refers only to the policies themselves. This doesn\u0027tensure that you\u0027re fully compliant with all requirements of a control. In addition, thecompliance standard includes controls that aren\u0027t addressed by any Azure Policydefinitions at this time. Therefore, compliance in Azure Policy is only a partial viewof your overall compliance status. The associations between controls and AzurePolicy Regulatory Compliance definitions for these compliance standards canchange over time.\n"
