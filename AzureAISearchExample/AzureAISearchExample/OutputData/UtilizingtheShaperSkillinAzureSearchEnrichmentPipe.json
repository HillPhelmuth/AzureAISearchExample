Examples of consolidated fields useful in search scenarios include combining afirst and last name into a single structure, city and state into a single structure, or nameand birthdate into a single structure to establish unique identity.Additionally, the Shaper skill illustrated in scenario 3 adds an optional sourceContextproperty to the input. The source and sourceContext properties are mutually exclusive. Ifthe input is at the context of the skill, simply use source.\r\nIf the input is at a differentcontext than the skill context, use the sourceContext. The sourceContext requires you todefine a nested input with the specific element being addressed as the source.The output name is always \u0022output\u0022. Internally, the pipeline can map a different name,such as \u0022analyzedText\u0022 as shown in the examples below, but the Shaper skill itselfreturns \u0022output\u0022 in the response. This might be important if you are debugging enricheddocuments and notice the naming discrepancy, or if you build a custom skill and arestructuring the response yourself.Microsoft.Skills.Util. ShaperSkillConsider a scenario where you want to create a structure called analyzedText that hastwo members: text and sentiment, respectively. In an index, a multi-part searchable fieldis called a complex type and it\u0027s often created when source data has a correspondingcomplex structure that maps to it.\uFF17 NoteThis skill isn\u0027t bound to Cognitive Services.\n"
