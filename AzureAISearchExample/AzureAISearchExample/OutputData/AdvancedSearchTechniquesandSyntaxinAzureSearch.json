SeeCreate Index for details on how index attributes are used in field definitions.A fuzzy search finds matches in terms that have a similar construction, expanding a termup to the maximum of 50 terms that meet the distance criteria of two or less.\r\nFor moreinformation, see Fuzzy search.To do a fuzzy search, use the tilde ~ symbol at the end of a single word with an optionalparameter, a number between 0 and 2 (default), that specifies the edit distance. Forexample, blue~ or blue~1 would return blue, blues, and glue.\r\nFuzzy search can only be applied to terms, not quotation-enclosed phrases, but you canappend the tilde to each term individually in a multi-part name or phrase. For example,Unviersty~ of~ Wshington~ would match on University of Washington.Proximity searches are used to find terms that are near each other in a document.

However, you can still use the searchFields parameter if you want to runa query where some parts are scoped to a specific field, and the rest could apply toseveral fields.\n"
