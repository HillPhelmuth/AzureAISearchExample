It also explains how to enable BM25 on oldersearch services.\r\nBM25 applies to:Queries that use the search parameter for full text search, on text fields having asearchable attribution.Scoring is scoped to searchFields, or to all searchable fields if searchFields isnull.The search engine uses BM25 to calculate a @searchScore for each match in a givenquery. Matching documents are ranked by their search score, with the top resultsreturned in the query response. It\u0027s possible to get some score variation in results, evenfrom the same query executing over the same search index, but usually these variationsare small and don\u0027t change the overall ranking of results.BM25 has defaults for weighting term frequency and document length.\n"
