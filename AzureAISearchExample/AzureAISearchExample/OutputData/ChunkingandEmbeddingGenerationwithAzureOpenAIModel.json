A 10% overlap on maximum tokens of 10 isone token.\r\nExample: maximum tokens = 10A fixed-sized chunking and embedding generation sample demonstrates bothchunking and vector embedding generation using Azure OpenAI embedding models.Barcelona is a city in Spain.It is close to the sea /n and the mountains. /nYou can both ski in winter and swim in summer.Barcelona is a city in Spain.\r\nIt is close to the sea /n and the mountains. /nYou can both ski in winter and swim in summer.Barcelona is a city in Spain.It is close to the sea /nand the mountains. /nYou can both ski in winterand swim in summer.Approach 2: Sentence chunking with \u002210% overlap\u0022Barcelona is a city in Spain.Spain.

You can use any embedding model, but thisarticle assumes Azure OpenAI embeddings models. Demos in the sample repositorytap the similarity embedding models of Azure OpenAI.Dimension attributes have a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 2048 dimensions pervector field.Query inputs require that you submit user-provided input to an embedding modelthat quickly converts human readable text into a vector.\n"
