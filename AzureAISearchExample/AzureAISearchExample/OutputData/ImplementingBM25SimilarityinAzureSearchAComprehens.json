In some cases,longer documents (such as a complete novel), are more likely tocontain many irrelevant terms, compared to shorter documents.\r\nIf you\u0027re running a search service that was created from March 2014 through July 15,2020, you can enable BM25 by setting a \u0022similarity\u0022 property on new indexes. Theproperty is only exposed on new indexes, so if you want BM25 on an existing index, youmust drop and rebuild the index with a \u0022similarity\u0022 property set toMicrosoft. Azure.Search.BM25Similarity.Once an index exists with a \u0022similarity\u0022 property, you can switch betweenBM25Similarity or ClassicSimilarity.The following links describe the Similarity property in the Azure SDKs.Client librarySimilarity property.NETSearchIndex.SimilarityJavaSearchIndex.setSimilarityJavaScriptSearchIndex.\n"
