During indexing, you can monitor query requests in theportal to ensure queries are completing in a timely manner.If indexing workloads introduce unacceptable levels of query latency, conductperformance analysis and review these performance tips for potential mitigation.Balancing workloadsCheck for updatesYou can begin querying an index as soon as the first document is loaded. If you know adocument\u0027s ID, the Lookup Document REST API returns the specific document.\r\nForbroader testing, you should wait until the index is fully loaded, and then use queries toverify the context you expect to see.You can use Search Explorer or a Web testing tool like Postman to check for updatedcontent.\r\nIf you added or renamed a field, use $select to return that field:search=*\u0026$select=document-id,my-new-field,some-old-field\u0026$count=trueIndexer overviewIndex large data sets at scaleIndexing in the portalAzure SQL Database indexerAzure Cosmos DB indexerAzure Blob Storage indexerAzure Table Storage indexerSecurity in Azure Cognitive SearchSee alsoCreate a suggester to enableautocomplete and suggested results in aqueryArticle\u202203/10/2023In Azure Cognitive Search, typeahead or \u0022search-as-you-type\u0022 is enabled through asuggester. A suggester provides a list of fields that undergo extra tokenization,generating prefix sequences to support matches on partial terms. For example, asuggester that includes a City field with a value for \u0022Seattle\u0022 will have prefixcombinations of \u0022sea\u0022, \u0022seat\u0022, \u0022seatt\u0022, and \u0022seattl\u0022 to support typeahead.Matches on partial terms can be either an autocompleted query or a suggested match.The same suggester supports both experiences.Typeahead can be autocomplete, which completes a partial input for a whole term query,or suggestions that invite click through to a particular match. Autocomplete produces aquery.\n"
