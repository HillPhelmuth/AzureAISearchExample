The geo.intersects function returns true ifa given point is within a given polygon, where the point is a field or range variable andthe polygon is specified as a constant passed as part of the filter.\r\nThe geo.distance function can also be used in the $orderby parameter to sort searchresults by distance from a given point. The syntax for geo.distance in $orderby is thesame as it is in $filter. When using geo.distance in $orderby, the field to which itapplies must be of type Edm.GeographyPoint and it must also be sortable. The following EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) defines the grammar of thegeo.distance and geo.intersects functions, as well as the geo-spatial values on whichthey operate:\uFF17 NoteWhen using geo.distance in the $orderby parameter, the field you pass to thefunction must contain only a single geo-point. In other words, it must be of typeEdm.GeographyPoint and not Collection(Edm.\n"
