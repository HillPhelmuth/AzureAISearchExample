The upper limit on fields includes both first-level fields and nested subfields in a complexcollection. For example, if an index contains 15 fields and has two complex collections with fivesubfields each, the field count of your index is 25. Indexes with a very large fields collection canbe slow. Limit fields and attributes to just those you need, and run indexing and query test toensure performance is acceptable. An upper limit exists for elements because having a large number of them significantlyincreases the storage required for your index. An element of a complex collection is defined asa member of that collection. For example, assume a Hotel document with a Rooms complexcollection, each room in the Rooms collection is considered an element. During indexing, theindexing engine can safely process a maximum of 3000 elements across the document as awhole. This limit was introduced in api-version=2019-05-06 and applies to complex collectionsonly, and not to string collections or to complex fields.You might find some variation in maximum limits if your service happens to be provisioned ona more powerful cluster. The limits here represent the common denominator.\n"
