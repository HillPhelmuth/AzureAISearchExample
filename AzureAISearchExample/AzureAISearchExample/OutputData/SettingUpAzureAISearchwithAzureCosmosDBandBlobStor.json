  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfx) NuGet packageAzure AI SearchThis tutorial uses Azure AI Search for indexing and queries, Azure Cosmos DB for onedata set, and Azure Blob Storage for the second data set.If possible, create all services in the same region and resource group for proximity andmanageability. In practice, your services can be in any region.\r\nThis sample uses two small sets of data that describe seven fictional hotels. One setdescribes the hotels themselves, and will be loaded into an Azure Cosmos DB database.The other set contains hotel room details, and is provided as seven separate JSON filesto be uploaded into Azure Blob Storage.1. Sign in to the Azure portal, and then navigate your Azure Cosmos DB accountOverview page.\r\n2. Select Data Explorer and then select New Database.Prerequisites\uFF17 NoteYou can use the free service for this tutorial. A free search service limits you to threeindexes, three indexers, and three data sources. This tutorial creates one of each.Before starting, make sure you have room on your service to accept the newresources.\r\n1 - Create servicesStart with Azure Cosmos DB3. Enter the name hotel-rooms-db. Accept default values for the remaining settings.4. Create a new container. Use the existing database you just created. Enter hotels forthe container name, and use /HotelId for the Partition key.5. Select Items under hotels, and then select Upload Item on the command bar.\r\nNavigate to and then select the file cosmosdb/HotelsDataSubset_CosmosDb.jsonin the project folder.6. Use the Refresh button to refresh your view of the items in the hotels collection.You should see seven new database documents listed.7. Copy a connection string from the Keys page into Notepad. You\u0027ll need this valuefor appsettings.json in a later step. If you didn\u0027t use the suggested database name\u0022hotel-rooms-db\u0022, copy the database name as well.1. Sign in to the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure storage account, select Blobs,and then select \u002B Container.2. Create a blob container named hotel-rooms to store the sample hotel room JSONfiles.\n"
