  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfThe free tier is based oninfrastructure that\u0027s shared with other customers. Because the hardware isn\u0027t dedicated, scale-up isn\u0027t supported, and storage is limited to 50 MB. Search units are billing units, allocated as either a replica or a partition. You need bothresources for storage, indexing, and query operations.\r\nTo learn more about SU computations,see Scale resource levels for query and index workloads.Subscription limits1212A search service is constrained by disk space or by a hard limit on the maximum number ofindexes or indexers, whichever comes first. The following table documents storage limits. Formaximum object limits, see Limits by resource.\r\nResourceFreeBasicS1S2S3S3\u00A0HDL1L2Service level agreement (SLA)NoYesYesYesYesYesYesYesStorage per partition50 MB2 GB25 GB100 GB200 GB200 GB1 TB2 TBPartitions per serviceN/A112121231212Partition sizeN/A2 GB25 GB100 GB200 GB200 GB1 TB2 TBReplicasN/A3121212121212 Basic has one fixed partition. Additional search units can be used to add replicas for largerquery volumes.\r\nService level agreements are in effect for billable services on dedicated resources. Freeservices and preview features have no SLA. For billable services, SLAs take effect when youprovision sufficient redundancy for your service. Two or more replicas are required for query(read) SLAs. Three or more replicas are required for query and indexing (read-write) SLAs.\r\nThenumber of partitions isn\u0027t an SLA consideration.
