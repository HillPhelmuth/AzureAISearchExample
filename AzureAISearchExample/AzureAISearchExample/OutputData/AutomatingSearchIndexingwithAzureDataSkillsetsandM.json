  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfA search indexer adds automation, reading data in native formats and serializing itinto JSON.An indexer has a data source and points to an index.An indexer might also have a skillset that adds AI enrichment and integratedvectorization to the indexing pipeline. Skillsets are always attached to an indexer.\r\nThey invoke machine learning to extract or chunk text, vectorize content, inferfeatures, or add structure to content so that it can be indexed by a search service.Versioned API docsKey conceptsAltogether, you can create the following objects on a search service:ObjectsDescriptionDatasourcesA data source connection used by an indexer to retrieve and refresh documents forindexing. Data sources have a type.\r\nYou can use the Microsoft-providedconnections for Azure, or third-party connectors through partners. See Datasources gallery for the full list.DocumentsConceptually, a document is an entity in your index. Mapping this concept to morefamiliar database equivalents: a search index equates to a table, and documents areroughly equivalent to rows in a table.\r\nDocuments exist only in an index, and areretrieved only through queries that target the documents collection (/docs) of anindex. All operations performed on the collection such as uploading, merging,deleting, or querying documents take place in the context of a single index, so theURL format document operations will always include /indexes/[index name]/docsfor a given index name. IndexesAn index is stored on your search service and populated with JSON documents thatare indexed and tokenized for information retrieval. The fields collection of an indexdefines the structure of the search document. Fields have a name, data types, andattributes that determine how it\u0027s used. For example, searchable fields are used infull text search, and thus tokenized during indexing. An index also defines otherconstructs, such as scoring profiles for relevance tuning, suggesters, semanticconfigurations, and custom analyzers.IndexersIndexers provide indexing automation.\n"
