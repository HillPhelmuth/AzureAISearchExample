  "Text": "C:\\Users\\adamh\\Downloads\\azure-search.pdfHTTPTo run indexer, you can use the portal or the API. In the portal, from the indexers list,select the indexer and click Run. One advantage to using the portal is that you canmonitor indexer status, note the duration of the job, and how many documents areprocessed. Portal pages are refreshed every few minutes.\r\nAlternatively, you can use REST to run the indexer:HTTPPUT https://[YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE].search.windows.net/indexers/[YOUR-INDEXER-NAME]?api-version=2021-04-30-Preview     Content-Type: application/json     api-key: [YOUR-ADMIN-KEY]     {         \u0022name\u0022 : \u0022\u003CYOUR-INDEXER-NAME\u003E\u0022,         ...\r\n\u0022cache\u0022: {             \u0022storageConnectionString\u0022: \u0022\u003CYOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-CONNECTION-STRING\u003E\u0022,             \u0022enableReprocessing\u0022: true         }     }     \u0022cache\u0022: {         \u0022ID\u0022: \u0022\u003CALPHA-NUMERIC STRING\u003E\u0022,         \u0022enableReprocessing\u0022: true,         \u0022storageConnectionString\u0022: \u0022DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=\u003CYOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT\u003E;AccountKey=\u003CYOUR-STORAGE-KEY\u003E;EndpointSuffix=core.\r\nwindows.net\u0022     } Step 5: Run the indexerFind the cache in Azure Storage, under Blob container. The container name will be ms-az-search-indexercache-\u003Csome-alphanumeric-string\u003E.A cache is created and used by an indexer. Its content is not human readable. To verify whether the cache is operational, modify a skillset and run the indexer, thencompare before-and-after metrics for execution time and document counts.Skillsets that include image analysis and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of scanneddocuments make good test cases. If you modify a downstream text skill or any skill thatis not image-related, the indexer can retrieve all of the previously processed image andOCR content from cache, updating and processing only the text-related changesindicated by your edits. You can expect to see fewer documents in the indexer executiondocument count, shorter execution times, and fewer charges on your bill.\n"
